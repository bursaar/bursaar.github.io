<p>Welcome to the demo of <em>Space Farm</em>. The nice people at <a href="https://www.snozbot.com" target="_blank">Snozbot</a> who own the intellectual property have given me permission to make this demo available on a limited basis, hence the private link and the password. Thanks for getting this far :-)</p>
<p>Below is a web-player running a version of the game. The build was made with the beta version of Unity 4.6, so if you haven't got that version of Unity installed, it may not work properly. If that's the case, you can download the game for your preferred platform after the web player.</p>
<p><strong>N.B.</strong> If playing in the web player, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">please right-click and select Fullscreen</span>.</p>

<h2>This Version</h2>

<p>This is a snapshot of the game taken in early August. We have since made some drastic design decisions about how and where to add content, so the version in active development is too rough to show.</p>
<h2>My Contribution</h2>

<p>I came on board when the structure of the game had been outlined, but there was still very little to do when playing. I worked with Chris Gregan, the original creator, to come up with extra content, including story beats, puzzles, flavour text, jokes, dialogue and more. The art has all been created by Terry Kenny and the music and audio is by Jason Farrell.</p>
