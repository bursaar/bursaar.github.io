<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-805" src="https://ben.ie/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Self-Portrait1.jpg" alt="Self Portrait" width="246" height="368" />I've always loved telling stories.</p>
<p>So does everyone, right? Everybody wants to feel like they're creating their own narrative. Now storytellers like us have the opportunity to evolve from narrative-building to world-building; creating universes and rulesets that give players their own feeling of relevancy and authorship with the materials we create. It's no longer an authored story, it's a curated experience, like an amusement park, or a meal in a Michelin Star restaurant. With the added advantage of course that it can be mobile, ubiquitous and flexible, responding to analytics and feedback to stay relevant and fun.</p>
<p>One of the most exciting aspects of such a rapidly growing medium is that the really interesting stuff so far is usually whatever's happening right now, eclipsed only by what comes tomorrow. At the moment, whether a game is made for raw profit, to communicate a brand's identity and message or some combination of both, like <em>Kim Kardashian: Hollywood</em>, the games are getting easier to make and the markets seems to keep expanding. Kim is forecast to make $200m this year alone, which is in addition whatever value is added to her name as a brand.</p>
<p><strong>"Yeah that's great, but why am I reading about you?"</strong></p>
<p>Good question! The answer is that there's a good chance I could be helpful.</p>
<p>I learned C++ in six months, C# in a month and Javascript in a week. My own background in storytelling and world-building comes from a related medium; I've worked in film for most of my <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2898140/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1" target="_blank">life as a writer and producer</a>, and have spent the last few years moving into game development. The most recent project I've engaged in is called Fungus, with a small company called <a href="https://fungus.snozbot.com" target="_blank">Snozbot</a>. Fungus is an add-on for Unity, a popular game development tool, that shortens the production time (and increases the production value) for a narrative game from six or seven months, down to about six to eight weeks.</p>

<p>I'm currently writing and designing an adventure game aimed at kids that showcases what we're doing with Fungus, which could end up being very useful as a way to create topical interactive experiences on web, iOS and Android.</p>
<p>As game development becomes more accessible and filmmaking requires more technical knowledge, the spheres are finally starting to merge and I couldn't be more excited to be at the forefront of the new age of audience engagement and participation.</p>
