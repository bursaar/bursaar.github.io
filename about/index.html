<p>I love playing computer games, and though I don't make them for a living, I think it's fair to say that my day job gives me a certain perspective on what games are and where they're going. No Robots is a blog about computer games and the industry and culture around them. I'm not focused on reviews, or news, but I'll definitely write them up if I think it's worth talking about. There's never been a more interesting time to be exploring the possibilities of gaming, and it's a testament to the incredible creative growth of the industry that that has been true for at least the last fifteen years.</p>
<p>Given my line of work as a film producer and my <span style="color: #000000;"><del>addiction</del></span> enthusiasm as a gamer, this is my addition to the conversation about the most exciting medium in the world.</p>
<p>You can see my <a href="https://ben.ie/film" target="_blank">film work here</a>, <a href="https://ben.ie/photography" target="_blank">photography here</a> and my <a title="My Games" href="https://ben.ie/my-games/" target="_blank">games here</a>.</p>
