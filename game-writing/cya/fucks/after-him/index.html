<p>[intro]The following letter was not selected for publication by the Irish Times.[/intro]</p>
<p>Sir,</p>
<p>[dropcap]I[/dropcap] would like to draw your attention to a problem in the fair city of Dublin. Yesterday I took a walk along the banks of the Grand Canal, a favoured route of mine for developing my poetry. I have in the past enjoyed throwing bread for the ducks and swans dwelling there as a way to calm my mind and, I don't mind admitting, discarding unwanted and often stale bread.</p>
<p>I thought nothing of it as I did this today, like any other day, lines of verse tumbling from my mind, when a mallard gave me what I thought was a particularly malevolent look and thus spat: "Tight faggot".</p>
<p>I was gobsmacked as I watched him paddle away and regurgitate my bread into the surprised face of a passing swan. Retreating to a local watering hole for a brandy, I took a seat and pondered my next move. What should I do?</p>
<p>[divider]</p>
<p>Dropping my bread, I had after the little plumaged twerp, but quickly lost him amongst some reeds. I picked up a stone and started throwing them into his safehouse, screaming after him as I did so until the magistrates explicably mistook my vengeance for vandalism and tossed me into the paddywagon. It was several hours before I could persuade my ex-wife to part with the bond for my temporary release, and so it was late by the time I arrived home.</p>
<p>Ascending the staircase to my apartment, I thought I noticed a burning smell, but upon reaching my door I saw a poorly-scrawled message pinned thereupon, reading "Don't throw stones when you live in a flammable house". Pushing the portal ajar, I recoiled in horror at the guana-smeared, smokey hell I found in place of my abode. The little bugger had defecated on all of my lamps and the resulting smoke was choking me as I stood there.</p>
