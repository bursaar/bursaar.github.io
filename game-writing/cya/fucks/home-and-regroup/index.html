<p>[intro]The following letter was not selected for publication by the Irish Times.[/intro]</p>
<p>Sir,</p>
<p>[dropcap]I[/dropcap] would like to draw your attention to a problem in the fair city of Dublin. Yesterday I took a walk along the banks of the Grand Canal, a favoured route of mine for developing my poetry. I have in the past enjoyed throwing bread for the ducks and swans dwelling there as a way to calm my mind and, I don't mind admitting, discarding unwanted and often stale bread.</p>
<p>I thought nothing of it as I did this today, like any other day, lines of verse tumbling from my mind, when a mallard gave me what I thought was a particularly malevolent look and thus spat: "Tight faggot".</p>
<blockquote><p>...I discovered my mouth to be packed full of terribly dry, stale bread...</p></blockquote>
<p>I was gobsmacked as I watched him paddle away and regurgitate my bread into the surprised face of a passing swan. Retreating to a local watering hole for a brandy, I took a seat and pondered my next move. What should I do?</p>
<p>[divider]</p>
<p>Downing the sherry, I headed home (a little warmer for the shockingly overpriced grog) and made for my front door. For all of my haste, I was ruined, for I slipped in an artfully placed pile of avian droppings and landed with my face looking up at the sky, or at least that's what I saw when I came to.</p>
<p>When I tried to groan, I discovered my mouth to be packed full of terribly dry, stale bread and a pair of beady eyes taking turns to peer down into mine. "How do you like the bread, shithead?" he asked. I elected not to answer as I watched his head retreat from view, only for it to be replaced by his bottom. He made a deposit upon my forehead, pirouetted again and looked down into my trembling eyes.</p>
<p>"Do you know who I am!?" I asked him? He made a noise that sounded for all the world like a very cruel laugh and flapped away. As I struggled to get to my feet (I am not as slim and graceful as I once was), I heard my first name called with more than a hint of disgust and, turning on my aching back, saw my ex-wife, her new husband and their young son looking at me.</p>
<p>"Claire!"</p>
<p>She wasn't forthcoming with an audible response, but looking down at myself I realised why the vindictive little twerp from the canal had been so mirthful. I wasn't wearing any pants or underpants, my modesty decorated by some guano-smeared feathers. Their young boy began to weep at the sight of me furiously trying to stand, where, upon success, fistfuls of lego fell out of my many pockets. "My lego!" he screamed. At this point, Claire gathered herself together and began hurling shopping bags at my head, demanding to know what I wanted with her darling Derek's "fucking" lego.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I would like to offer the motion that all ducks in Dublin City should be put to death by the Department of The Environment.</p>
<p>Yours etc.,</p>
<p>Avo The Magnificent</p>
