Can you do X?"</h3>
<p>If you're viewing this page and you're searching for someone to join your team, then I'm going to tell you what I can do to make your life easier.</p>
<p><strong>TECHNICALLY</strong>, I love problem solving and have always enjoyed fixing and building things. I'd be more than happy to take a programming test or present you with my portfolio to show you examples of my coding ability. <strong>My primary languages are C++ and C#</strong>. I would be an industrious and enthusiastic addition to your dev team. I'm not just saying that – I love to work!</p>
<p><strong>CREATIVELY</strong>, my primary strength is in writing. I'm an accomplished photographer, videographer, director and editor, but if you want someone who can add value to your company by writing <strong>flavour text, press releases, publicity materials, dialogue, storylines, character outlines, design docs, blog posts</strong> – anything! – I'm your man. I love writing and I've done it a lot. I have a good ear for dialect and a great sense of tone.</p>
<p><strong>LOGISTICALLY</strong>, I've worked as a producer and production manager, and handled a lot of admin – normally under quite a bit of pressure. If you wanted someone to contribute to running your office or projects more smoothly, I can <strong>manage teams, schedules and budgets</strong>, file a stack of invoices or hound people for a meeting like you wouldn't believe.</p>
<p>I really like being a team player, and apart from being able to code, write and organise, I can also <strong>shoot</strong> (kickstarter!) and <strong>edit</strong> (trailers!) <strong>video</strong> to a professional standard, <strong>direct actors</strong> (voice acting! cut-scenes!) shoot <strong>stills</strong>, manage your <strong>social media</strong>, deal with <strong>press</strong>, <strong>customers</strong> and <strong>clients</strong> and build a wicked rollercoaster in <em>Minecraft</em>, though I don't mind doing that last one in my own time.</p>
<h3>"Wow. You sound like you could definitely come in handy, what's your story?"</h3>
<p>I've been interesting in making worlds and telling stories since I was a kid. Before I owned a camera, I was blagging gear and persuading mates (and strangers) into helping me out on my films. At the age of 22 I finished my first feature, a comedy called <em>Rise of The Bricks</em>. I had no idea what I was doing, nor any money, but it was pretty good, and got a lot of laughs.</p>
<p>I was fortunate enough that my debut film was noticed and I <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2898140/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1" target="_blank">spent a few years in the film business</a>, moving between writing, directing, producing and all the interesting stuff in-between, logistical and creative. I had always, always loved computer games, truth be told, probably more than I loved movies, but not having progressed past QBASIC in my childhood, I was intimidated by the prospect of entering the industry.</p>

<p>After winning some awards, going out on my own and wrapping up a couple of big projects, I had an unfamiliar feeling: a lull! I had been dabbling in Unity, Gamemaker and learning some Javascript online in my spare time, and I realised I was itching for a new challenge. A master's-level course in C++ for games later, and I've had some wonderful experiences that have only made me more certain that this is what I want to do with my life.</p>
<p>I recently spent three months learning a lot while interning for Dublin indie <a href="https://www.snozbot.com" target="_blank">Snozbot</a>, working on their adventure game <a href="https://fungus.snozbot.com/games/spaaace-faaarm" target="_blank"><em>Spaaace Faaarm!</em></a> and I'm incredibly proud of the work we've done and the ways I've grown in that time. I'm still contributing to that project and also interning at <a href="https://www.gambrinous.com" target="_blank">Gambrinous</a> on their awesome pen'n'paper-style roguelike <a href="https://www.gambrinous.com/games/dungeoneering/" target="_blank"><em>Guild of Dungeoneering</em></a>. I've competed (<a href="https://thenorobotsblog.com/game/moustache-task-course/" target="_blank">and even won</a>!) in game jams, <a href="https://ben.ie" target="_blank">created my own games</a>, landed a job <a href="https://ben.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PressReader-Irish-Independent-Insider-Thursday-7-August-2014-Page-32.pdf" target="_blank">reviewing games</a> for a national print publication and fallen even further in love with the medium.</p>
