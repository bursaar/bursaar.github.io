<p>Hey everyone, I'm participating in <a href="https://www.ludumdare.com" target="_blank">Ludum Dare</a> at the moment, a challenge to create a game from scratch in 48 hours. I'm creating a strategy game based around the excess and worst practices of the boom, specifically as it occurred in Ireland.</p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-4234 aligncenter" src="https://ben.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Screenshot-2014-08-23-13.34.37-300x169.png" alt="Screenshot 2014-08-23 13.34.37" width="300" height="169" /></p>
<p>This is where you come in – I'm building the game around my own experiences and memories, anecdotes and news stories, with a little bit of research as I have time, but I'd love to hear your horror stories from the Celtic Tiger, the most wasteful, extravagant, arrogant, greedy, short-sighted bullshit that you saw or heard. If it's true, please link to a news story or other reliable source. If it's untrue, that's fine, though I may present verified material differently to unsubstantiated (or entertainingly invented) material.</p>
<p>I'm concentrating on developers, but anything about politicians, supermarkets, upwardly-mobile Irish citizens, ridiculous startups etc. would all be most welcome.</p>
<p>If you include your name and email address and I use your material, I'll include you in the credits for the game, under "<strong>Additional Material by</strong>". If I don't use your material, I will still include your name under "<strong>Thanks to</strong>". If you'd rather be anonymous, that's OK too.</p>
<p>You can submit your material through the contact form in the sidebar (bottom of the page on mobile browsers) and follow me on twitter for updates over the next couple of days.</p>
<p>Thanks so much for taking the time to read about my project :-)</p>
