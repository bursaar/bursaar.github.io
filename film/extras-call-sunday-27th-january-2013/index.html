<h1>Thank you kindly for stopping by. This event has passed.</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #c0c0c0;">Hi there! Thanks for taking a look at this for me, I really, really appreciate it. We will be doing our best to make it as interesting and pleasant an hour as we can, and if you're interested in filmmaking at all, I will be happy to make myself available to answer any questions.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #c0c0c0;">You can download the directions / movement order here: <a href="https://ben.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Uniquely-Dublin-Movement-Order11.pdf"><span style="color: #c0c0c0;">Uniquely Dublin - Movement Order</span></a></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #c0c0c0;">The piece is written and directed by <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1818085" target="_blank"><span style="color: #c0c0c0;">Denis McArdle</span></a>, who also directed our short film <a href="https://barrysfilm.com" target="_blank"><span style="color: #c0c0c0;">Barry's Bespoke Bakery</span></a> (currently on the festival circuit). We will be shooting the piece in <a href="https://www.rte.ie/archives/exhibitions/681-history-of-rte/704-rte-1960s/139352-glenties-tidiest-town-in-ireland/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #c0c0c0;">this style</span></a>. The location is at the top of this page, <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?saddr=Christ+Church+Cathedral,+Christchurch+Place,+Ireland&amp;daddr=Watling+Street&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=53.344954,-6.278408&amp;spn=0.004893,0.014216&amp;sll=53.34477,-6.27455&amp;sspn=0.009787,0.028431&amp;geocode=Fdj0LQMdok6g_yHL3KJoJnE1kikbD0BKJgxnSDHL3KJoJnE1kg%3BFW__LQMd9Rug_w&amp;oq=Christ&amp;dirflg=w&amp;mra=ltm&amp;t=m&amp;z=17" target="_blank"><span style="color: #c0c0c0;">Watling Street, Dublin 8</span></a> at 1pm on Sunday the 27th of January 2013 until around 2pm.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #c0c0c0;">We are asking for people to arrive in something that would suit the period. It doesn't need to be genuine or vintage, but just not ostensibly modern, either. Colour isn't important, as it'll be in monochrome when we finish it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #c0c0c0;">  </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #c0c0c0;">If you can, please shoot me an email to <a href="mailto:ben@ben.ie" target="_blank"><span style="color: #c0c0c0;">ben@ben.ie</span></a> to let me know you'll be coming along. You can contact me for any questions you might have at 087 935 0483. Thank you again :-)</span></p>
