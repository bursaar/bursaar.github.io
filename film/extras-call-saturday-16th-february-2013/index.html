<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">[intro]First of all, thanks for considering helping us out - this is a small project but it's built around a great idea. Please check out the links below and drop us a line in the form to let us know that you're interested in coming out.[/intro]</span></p>
<p><img class="wp-image-2221 alignleft" alt="dublin65" src="http://ben.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/dublin65.jpeg" width="176" height="235" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">This shoot was</span> <a title="Extras Call: Sunday 27th January 2013 (updated)" href="http://ben.ie/extras-call-sunday-27th-january-2013/">originally scheduled for the end of January 2013</a><span style="color: #000000;">, but we had to move it due to adverse weather conditions.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> We are still confirming the location. As soon as we have it locked down we'll post the details here and email and text anybody who gets in touch. The shoot will be from approx. 12pm until 2:30pm.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">The film is based on a real-life incident in 1965 when a horse fell into a hole in Dublin City Centre. The poor thing had to be put down (there will be no horses in this film) and it led to a gaffe on live radio when a young boy misinterpreted a question and accidentally swore, though the incident is quaint and tame by today's standards. We are restaging the incident as an RTÉ TV broadcast as a celebration of all things Dublin.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The piece is written and directed by <span style="color: #333399;"><a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1818085" target="_blank"><span style="color: #333399;">Denis McArdle</span></a></span>, who also directed our short film <span style="color: #333399;"><a href="http://barrysfilm.com" target="_blank"><span style="color: #333399;">Barry's Bespoke Bakery</span></a></span> (currently on the festival circuit). I am producing, with a small talented crew generously lending a hand. We will be shooting the piece in <span style="color: #333399;"><a href="http://www.rte.ie/archives/exhibitions/681-history-of-rte/704-rte-1960s/139352-glenties-tidiest-town-in-ireland/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #333399;">this style</span></a></span>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">We are asking for people to arrive in something that would suit the period. It doesn't need to be genuine or vintage, but just not ostensibly modern, either. Colour isn't important, as it'll be in black &amp; white when we finish it. We'll also have a couple of props and pieces of wardrobe to round out the look.</span></p>
