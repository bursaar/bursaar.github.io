<p><span style="color: #888888;">Hi there!</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #888888;">If you're reading this then you're involved in the shoot for the promo for <i>Journey To The End Of The Night</i>. Below you'll find the script, a map and a call sheet, which contains a running order, cast list and necessary contact details.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #888888;">The map in the header of this page is scrollable and zoomable. If you'd rather view the map in a separate window, <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/preview/@53.3438419,-6.2389797,19z" target="_blank"><span style="color: #888888;">you can click here.</span></a></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #888888;">You can download the script here:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #888888;">[box style="download"]<a href="https://ben.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Journey-To-The-End-Of-The-Night-Promo-Script1.pdf"><span style="color: #888888;">Journey To The End Of The Night Promo Script</span></a>[/box]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #888888;">If you haven't seen a call sheet, it's a breakdown of who and what is needed where and when, along with providing some important contact details.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #888888;">[box style="download"] - + Call sheet out of date + - /box]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #888888;">For tomorrow's apparel, there is a chance of rain and it will be quite chilly, so I'd ask that everyone wear the kind of clothes you would to go for a jog in this kind of weather.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #888888;">[box style="info"]Please wear/bring: <strong>runners, warm socks, breathable pants, a hoodie or light sweater and ideally a light jacket</strong>.[/box]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #888888;">I'll also be asking you to sign a release form. These are quite standard and are just giving me the right to use any footage of you we get tomorrow. Myself or someone from my team will be handing you one to sign tomorrow, but you can take a peek at the language here.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #888888;">[box style="download"]<a href="https://ben.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Journey-To-The-End-Of-The-Night-Day-Player-Release-Form.pdf"><span style="color: #888888;">Journey To The End Of The Night Day Player Release Form</span></a>[/box]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #888888;">I'm really looking forward to this shoot, thank you all in advance for helping out.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #888888;">Since this will be the first time I'm meeting some of you, here's me in a meme (I'm on the right):</span></p>
