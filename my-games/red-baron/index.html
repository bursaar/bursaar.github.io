<p>This game is a simple scrolling shooter. The core gameplay was quite simple, so I added a couple of fun dynamics;</p>
<ul>
<li>Each bullet costs you one point.</li>
<li>When you fire a bullet and have no points left, it will do you one unit of damage.</li>
<li>When you hit 100 points you will fire three bullets instead of one.</li>
<li>The higher your score, the higher your rate of movement.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that the design doc is for the earliest version of the game, which used a lot more randomisation and was missing the mechanics I've mentioned above. It's worth looking at for comparison, if you're interested.</p>
<p>The game was made in <a href="https://www.yoyogames.com/legacy" target="_blank">Game Maker 8.1</a> for Mac and then exported from the Mac and PC versions. The design document was made in <a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com" target="_blank">Scrivener</a>.</p>
