<h2>Download: PC / <a href="https://games.ben.ie/platformer/platformer_v01.zip" target="_blank">Mac</a> / Design Doc / <a href="https://games.ben.ie/platformer/platformer_v01.gmk" target="_blank">Gamemaker File</a></h2>
<p>This is the first iteration of a platform game. There is no aim or goal yet, just a player character, a single level and some inert platforms to jump around on.</p>
<p>The basic controls are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Left – Move left</li>
<li>Right – Move right</li>
<li>Up/Space – Jump</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that the design doc and PC versions are forthcoming.</p>
<p>The game was made in <a href="https://www.yoyogames.com/legacy" target="_blank">Game Maker 8.1</a> for Mac and then exported from the Mac version. The design document is being written in <a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com" target="_blank">Scrivener</a>.</p>
