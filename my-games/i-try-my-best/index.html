<h2>Play: <a href="http://philome.la/bursaar/i-try-my-best">Published</a> / <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/165719/twinejam/Index.html" target="_blank">Work In Progress</a></h2>
<p>The game is written in <a href="http://twinery.org" target="_blank">Twine</a>, so it's a game-like Choose Your Own Adventure story. Studying game development at the moment, I wanted to exercise my newfound coding confidence and stretch my design muscles, but I also wanted to make something that was in some way personal, even if it wasn't about me exactly, I wanted it to be definitively mine. I wrote the game as part of the <a href="http://www.dublintwinejam.com" target="_blank">Dublin Twine &amp; Jam</a>.</p>
<p>Some points of note:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is a slightly dynamic headshot with a confidence level at the top of each page past a certain point in the story.</li>
<li>Each confidence level has a bank of random quotes that could be applicable to that frame of mind.</li>
<li>You will read the story very slightly differently (only one or two passages) depending on your gender and sexual orientation.</li>
<li>Though it is buggy, there is an adventure-game-style puzzle in the living room of the party.</li>
<li>There is a timing element established early in the story to set up a not-yet-implemented flirting mechanic later on, to keep the game exciting.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Currently Working On:</h3>
<p>A design doc to tease out the rest of the story with the priority on flirting with the girl on the couch.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Recent Updates:</h3>
