In 2013 I was turning my back on film production as a career and trying to reinvent myself as someone who worked in games. I had no hard skills, little direction, and felt pressure to get the pivot baked in before I turned 30. I had been listening to some gaming-related podcasts for years, including the still wonderful Gamers With Jobs Conference Call. I was feeling my way through engaging with Game Dev Twitter, when that was a thing, I watched and loved _Indie Game: The Movie_, as both a filmmaker and a wannabe game maker. I even got a column in a weekly newspaper magazine reviewing games (and DVDs!), which meant a steady stream of discs and codes sent to me, which certainly helped me maintain a diet of current releases even as I was basically, erm, "Income-Free" (the income from the column was not the sort of money you'd splash around on Xbox and Steam games).

While I was eagerly trying to figure out my place in this industry – would I work as QA? Try for a creative position? Or learn to code? – I noticed the rise of Polygon. It was honestly hard to miss, since they'd assembled a kind of a supergroup of games media talent, folks I'd been reading elsewhere like Justin and Griffin McElroy and Brian Crecente, and created a _very_ splashy documentary series on what it took to decide to create something like a games media website.

It's fair to say that I developed a low-level parasocial relationship with these folks, which I understood as such. I became emotionally invested in their success, and they made it easy to root for them. The site looked awesome, they had great coverage. It was my first port of call for reviews, features and coverage of things like E3 and GDC. Years later at GDC I bumped into one of their journalists (the lovely Dave Tach) who was a delight to speak with.
