If this were a conversation, I'd be quietly flattered. This is a website for my work and personal lives. My film work sits here, along with my photography, writing and blog. [/intro]</p>

<p>[dropcap]M[/dropcap]y name is Ben Keenan, I have a lot of interests and skills. If you'd like to know more about my skills, please check out my <a title="Film &amp; Video Work" href="http://ben.ie/" target="_blank">filmmaking</a> and <a title="Photography" href="http://ben.ie/photography/" target="_blank">photography</a> portfolios, if you'd like to know about my interests, please check out my <a title="Blog" href="http://ben.ie/blog/" target="_blank">blog</a>.</p>
<p>I'm deeply interested in storytelling - working in film for twelve years and taking photos for six. I write, produce and direct, in that order of commonality. I live in Dublin, Ireland, though I travel as much as I can, I have lived here all my life.</p>
<p>I have produced several short films, including three fully funded projects; <em><a href="http://barrysfilm.com" target="_blank">Barry's Bespoke Bakery</a></em> (<a href="http://www.irishfilmboard.ie/irish_film_industry/news/Successful_Short_Shorts_Teams_Announced/1722" target="_blank">Irish Film Board</a>), <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1458632/" target="_blank">The Chronoscope</a></em> (<a href="http://www.wicklow.ie/apps/wicklowbeta/arts/publicart/commission8.aspx" target="_blank">Wicklow County Council</a>) and <em>This is Not A Conspiracy Theory</em> (<a href="http://rte.ie" target="_blank">RTÉ</a>). In my late teens and into the start of my twenties, I wrote, directed and co-produced the feature film <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1581644/" target="_blank">The Rise of The Bricks</a></em>, starring Emmett Scanlan, Eoin Macken, Ciaran McNamee, Cillian Scott and Cathal Sheahan.</p>
<p>You can catch my more recent and frequent work over at <em><a href="http://www.halfagiraffe.tv">Half a Giraffe</a></em>, a comedy project I am developing with some talented folks.</p>
<p>If you would like to use any of my images for anything please contact me. I am very reasonable and obliging!</p>
