<p>Good news! I've started writing game (and DVD!) reviews for<em> Insider Magazine</em>, free with the <em>Irish Independent</em> every Thursday. I love writing about games at the best of times, but having my (deftly sub-edited) pieces published nationally is a heady thrill. If you live in Ireland, you can pick up a copy on Thursdays in newsagents and shops across the country.</p>
