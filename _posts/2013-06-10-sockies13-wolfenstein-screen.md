<p>This is one of the videos I made for the 2013 Social Media Awards. The theme of the ceremony was 8-bit, so I tried to do something a bit fun with it, evoking old computer games. This one's based on Wolfenstein 3D, though I eschewed the Nazis! The screen was made using a combination of Photoshop, Premiere Pro and After Effects. I used the distributed rendering function of the render engine to render all of the screens on two computers at once, but these ones in particular took a VERY long time to cook since there's forced motion blur on the shatter effect, which really took its toll.</p>
