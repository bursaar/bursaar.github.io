<p>Had the good fortune to visit Glengarriff recently with <a href="https://www.nathalie.ie/blog">Nathalie</a>. She was doing a wedding shoot down there and took me down to beautiful West Cork with her. En route, we stopped for some delicious lunch in Avoca, which Nathalie duly took gorgeous pics of (I was too busy scoffing). We then noticed these lovely little guys on the way back to the car:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://farm7.static.flickr.com/6140/6039525270_2ae46265dc_b.jpg" alt="Hangin' In There" width="552" height="1024" /></p>

<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://farm7.static.flickr.com/6089/6039516596_d6234a64ea_z.jpg" alt="Hanging On" width="640" height="427" /></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://farm7.static.flickr.com/6089/6038981469_6366f6fdfa_z.jpg" alt="Crawlin'" width="640" height="427" /></p>

<p>Then once we were in Glengarriff and had a bit of time, we hit Seal Island (I wanted to include a link to Google Maps here, but there's too little coverage of West Cork, it's pretty off the grid). Nathalie got some <a href="https://nathalie.ie/blog/2011/08/way-out-west/" target="_blank">stunners</a>.</p>

<p>All credit for the macro shots goes to <a href="https://www.nathalie.ie/blog">Nathalie </a>- she kindly let me use her beautiful <a href="https://nathalie.ie/blog/about/">100mm macro</a> lens, and some of the bee shots are certainly hers, we both took so many, we found it impossible to figure out whose were whose!</p>
