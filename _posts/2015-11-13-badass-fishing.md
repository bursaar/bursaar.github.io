<p>I had the pleasure of helping build this ambitious 2D arcade-style free to play game for mobile for most of 2015.</p>
<p>As the second programmer on the project, I created or contributed to most of the game's systems and gave feedback and ideas for the game's design, prototyped features and owned large portions of the game's codebase.</p>
<p>The game is still in development, so I can't share a build publicly, but I would be happy to show you a build in person if we meet!</p>
