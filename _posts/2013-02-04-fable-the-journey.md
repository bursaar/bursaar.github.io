<p>If you have a Kinect but reckon you’re far too old for <i>Kinectimals</i> (even though you play it when nobody’s around), <i>Fable: The Journey</i> might be for you. Glitchy Kinect controls suck some fun out of the combat, but the game wins you over with your horse Seren who you feed, heal and even brush as you play. The strong story (filled with humour and scary bits) will draw you in, despite sometimes having to wave your arms around in frustration.</p>
