<p>It's a numbing series of numbers, but the good news is that the gamut is quite wide, from the $600 Zotac model to the $6,000 Falcon Northwest, though most seem to be around the $1,200 mark. We still don't know why owning a Steam Machine is going to be a good idea for anybody but the most keen hobbyists. I don't doubt there'll be a good experience, but at a cost substantially higher than any console for less of the functionality.</p>
<p>I will say that if the local streaming turns out to be efficient and well-implemented, I don't see why you couldn't install the SteamOS on a very small, cheap machine, even something as basic as a Raspberry Pi, and stream your spec-hungry games in 1080p from somewhere else in your home. That'd be something I'd be very interested in and could see catching on faster than these too-much-for-too-little offerings.</p>
