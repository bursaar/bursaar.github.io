<p style="text-align: left;">Grand Canal Dock is an oft-photographed area; it's one of the few big Celtic Tiger developments that actually worked, and I think that's part of its appeal. I spent six months working around the corner on Barrow Street, mostly doing visual effects on <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1582271/" target="_blank">The Good Doctor</a>, and in that time, became familiar with the space.</p>
