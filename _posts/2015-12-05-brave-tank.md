<p>Conceived and designed by <a href="https://twitter.com/gofungus">Chris Gregan</a>, I worked on this game with Chris and Emmett Corrigan in late 2015 while contracting for <a href="https://snozbot.itch.io">Snozbot</a>. Since it's a satirical take on the revisionist history of colonists, we tried to find a classy way to shock without being completely gratuitous. I think we did pretty well!</p>

<p>Highlights of working on this game include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Coming up with a lightweight "analytics" system for tracking every bullet fired, every litre of fuel spent, every meter driven and the number of bears crushed (with cause of death!)</li>
<li>Tuning the appearance, behaviour and movement of the 3D tank in a 2D environment</li>
<li>Designing the tank controls</li>
<li>Simulating a marching formation behaviour in the "attackers"</li>
<li>Listening to what felt like hours of recordings of screams and explosions to get the mixÂ <em>just</em> right</li>
<li>Writing vicious satire</li>
<li>Hiding a secret ending ;-)</li>
</ul>
