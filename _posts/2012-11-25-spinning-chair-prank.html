<p>This was one of our first pieces to feature visual effects. In mid-2010, I began working in VFX. We conceived this piece around an effect I had been practising. The image is desaturated and noised to make it feel cheaper than it is, and the editing is meant to feel amateurish, with the intention of making the visual effect more surprising.</p>
