  content: "Anorak mode: engage.\r\n\r\nOne that I find interesting is how the sci-fi
    novel, Roadside Picnic was transformed for both film, in 1979 Russia, and games,
    in 2007 Ukraine. Both center around The Zone, an area where a cataclysmic event
    has made things very strange, and where \"Stalkers\" often meet a violent end
    in the attempt to find something worth selling.\r\n\r\nWhile the novel had thrills
    as well as food for thought, the two other projects went in different directions.
    The Strugatsky brothers wrote a screenplay for Tartovsky and the result was a
    somber, slow, meditative yet oppressive film, Stalker.\r\n\r\nS.T.A.L.K.E.R. on
    the other hand, was at it's core a western-style revenge tale. Mechanically, it
    was an fps, but like Stalker, the question of what was to be found at the center
    of the Zone cast a shadow over everything, and the environment was as likely to
    kill you as a competitor was.\r\n\r\nUnusually, though the fear of the Zone in
    each work is loyal to the original work, it is only in the game that the feel
    of the Zone is truly manifest, at the same time that it's story brings it closer
    to genre tropes.\r\n\r\nAs for film-to-game projects, I've often though of Die
    Hard Trilogy on playstation as being the gold standard. While the second of the
    three games on the disc was Virtua Cop with John McClane quips, the first and
    third boiled down the essence of each of the respective films, and made a game
    out of them.\r\n\r\nAlthough I haven't played it, Escape from Butcher Bay, part
    of the Chronicles of Riddick, was very well received. Notably, David Twohy and
    Vin Diesel, in many ways \"Team Riddick\", both took an active role in the creative
    process of the game, so that's pretty interesting.\r\n\r\nThe least terrible film
    of a game I can think of might be Silent Hill. As horrors go, it's pretty creative,
    it was cruel without going into torture-porn territory, and there were parts which
    quite successfully recreated the atmosphere of some parts of the games."

  content: "Anorak engagement mode: engaged\n\nI have never managed to get into S.T.A.L.K.E.R.,
    though I've had a copy since it hit Steam. I love the atmosphere though. \n\nI've
    also never played the Riddick games, I've heard they're surprisingly good. I remember
    they had first-person melée combat, which seems a bit bloody."

<p>I&#39;ve long been curious about the best way to create crossovers between games and films. Other media have figured it out for the most part. The book is always better than the movie, etc., but Hollywood&#39;s approach to adapting books and plays for the silver screen is, by and large, pretty solid.</p>
<p>Of course, movies based on games or games on movies are usually utter dreck. There are <a href="http://www.polygon.com/2013/7/18/4535878/at-comic-con-optimism-for-future-of-video-game-movies" target="_blank">good theories </a>out there about why this happens. One I like is that for years most Hollywood execs had never played a computer game before, and that that is all about to change as the elite of tinseltown is permeated by people of my generation who have grown up playing, loving and understanding computer games, just as comic book movies quite suddenly got good in the last few years. Another theory is that games are fundamentally unfilmable. How can we make a film about a character who carries fifteen different rifles, which you can&#39;t see when they&#39;re holstered, who has adventures with multiple outcomes in a branching storyline with a duration measured in the tens or even hundreds of hours. In any world, isn&#39;t a single strand of that story, a simplification just a cheapened experience?</p>

<p>One of the biggest book to film adaptations in the last couple of years was <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1392170/" target="_blank"><em>The Hunger Games</em></a>. I read the book about a year before the film came out and loved it. I reckoned it could make a great film, and thankfully I was right, they did a really good job.</p>

<p>When I heard the studio was bringing out an iOS game to go with it I couldn&#39;t help but eyeroll. "FFS, when will they LEARN?", but sometimes it&#39;s nice to be wrong. They took a page from <em>Deus Ex: Human Revolution</em>&#39;s narrative director Mary DeMarle, who believes that the best way to adapt a computer game to another medium, is to not to adapt it at all, but to play to the strengths of different media and explore the world and characters with a different story and experience; separate or intersecting. With <em>Deus Ex</em>, that meant releasing a (surprisingly good) novel that acts as a prequel to a parallel story to the main thread – still with me? – an experience that enriched the main game, and was in turn enriched by it.</p>

<p>With <em>The Hunger Games</em>, instead of creating a shallow narrative experience, they boiled the game down to a simple mechanic that did more for your understanding of who Katniss is than a clumsy cutscene ever could have.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hunger-games-girl-on-fire/id512146822?mt=8" target="_blank"><em>The Hunger Games: Girl On Fire</em></a>, you play as Katniss running through The Arena, firing her bow and arrow at a steady stream of enemies. It&#39;s a game about constantly running, and fighting against an endless stream of enemies. It&#39;s an elegant stylisation, totally embracing the medium and platform it&#39;s running on. It&#39;s a small, fun game with polished gameplay. It doesn&#39;t do much to enrich the experience of reading the book or watching the film, but it does nothing to cheapen it either. We can only hope that this is the way things are going.</p>
