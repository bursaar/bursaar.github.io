And so can you! Too! The Even Better Edition.

I've [previously]({% post_url 2024-06-01-deploying-from-gitlab-and-so-can-you %}) shared a kind of ugly but effective `.gitlab-ci.yml` file that I've been using to automatically deploy builds, but it was incomplete, and didn't cover:
- Incrementing the version
- Building the thing

It was also really, super ugly.

Since <a href="/tags/godot">moving to Godot</a>, I've fallen in love with the idea of being able to build and run automated tests in Linux Docker containers. I tried this with a project I've been working on (and off and on again) for a while, called <a href="https://bursaar.itch.io/the-bacon-game">The Bacon Game</a>:</p>

<iframe frameborder="0" src="https://itch.io/embed/2154665?border_width=0" width="550" height="165"><a href="https://bursaar.itch.io/the-bacon-game">The Bacon Game by Ben Marquez Keenan</a></iframe>

I started this project in Unity, and then in Godot Mono, which is a version of Godot that supports C#. This worked great at first, but I found that the Mono version of Godot introduced tonnes of issues and hassles when trying to do automated building and testing. The containerised environment's setup was much more fragile and fiddly. Also, C# is owned by Microsoft, and if I'm going to go all hippy crunchy granola on this, then I may as well do it properly. So I took The Bacon Game and rewrote it in GD Script, Godot's purpose-built language, which was actually faster and more pleasant to do than I expected.</p>

Once I had it all running as it had before, but without C#, and had fixed a couple of bugs, I decided to dive back into the automation side, and found great <a href="https://gitlab.com/barichello/godot-ci">templates and examples created by the amazing Barichello</a>, the GitLab user who created the container images I'm using for this.

You'll need to get a few things together to use this, namely setting these up as environment variables in your GitLab's CI/CD settings under Variables:

- Itch username as `ITCHIO_USERNAME` (This can be set on the Group level, rather than Repo level, if you're working on more than one game)
- Itch.io Butler API key as `BUTLER_API_KEY` (ditto, this can be set on the Group level, but recommend only doing that if your group is private)
- Itch game's slug as `ITCHIO_GAME` (only really makes sense for this to be done on the repo itself)

```yaml
image: barichello/godot-ci:4.2.2

variables:
  EXPORT_NAME: the-bacon-game #my game's name â€“ plug in your own, no spaces

  - test

```

A couple of other requirements, you'll need to add a `version.txt` that has your version in it. 

Worth noting that this version will not be reflected in your game's binary, this is only a repo/itch concept. I'd like to evolve this script to increment/inject the version to the project's settings in time. You'll also need to add a `CHANGELOG.md` file, that starts like this:

```
# CHANGELOG

<!--- next entry here -->
```

Last thing to note is that <a href="https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release#commit-message-format">your commits will need to follow a specific format</a>. In time I've adjusted to following this approach on all my projects since it makes the commit history more useful, but some people may find it annoying.
