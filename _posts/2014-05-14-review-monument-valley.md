<p>If you like M.C. Escher and beautiful puzzle games, then you’re in luck. This is about perspective and problem-solving, rotating, sliding and switching geometry on each level to guide the hero to her goal. The game’s design is so gorgeous that it should be played on as large a screen as you can manage.</p>
<p>While it shares some ideas and mechanics with <em>Echochrome</em> and <em>Portal</em> – both puzzle games with rather difficult points – this is definitely a far easier affair, with most levels solvable in a couple of minutes. This wouldn’t be much of a problem for a mobile game, except that there aren’t that many levels, so the entire game could conceivably be exhausted in a single long play session if you’re really enjoying it – a move the designers say they made to give closure to the game’s (very slight) story.</p>
<p>It’s only available for iOS at the moment, but an Android version has been announced.</p>
