<p>W00t! It looks like <em>Deus Ex: Human Revolution – Director's Cut</em> is finally available on Mac! The PC version dropped in October, so this is a little overdue, but I personally can't WAIT to get stuck in on my MacBook. If you ever picked it up on Steam and own a Mac, check out your Mac-ready list, you should see it there now.
