<p><i>PC, Mac, Xbox 360, PS3, PSVita, iOS, PS4, Xbox One; €22.99, <a href="https://telltalegames.com/thewolfamongus" data-mce-href="https://telltalegames.com/thewolfamongus">telltalegames.com/thewolfamongus</a></i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 30px;" data-mce-style="text-indent: 30px;">The official premise –&nbsp;fairytale characters hiding in plain sight in New York city –&nbsp;may sound intriguing or possibly off-putting, but it totally misses the point either way. At its heart, this is a gritty, hard-boiled detective story with great characters and a wry wit.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30px;" data-mce-style="text-indent: 30px;">From Telltale Games, the studio that created the award-winning games based on The Walking Dead, this is not your average point and click adventure game. As well as the incredible flair for storytelling that we can expect these days from Telltale, The Wolf Among Us is violent, exciting, dirty and very, very grown up. It also manages to push the design to places previously unheard of, with beautiful neon-noir art direction.</p>
<p data-mce-style="text-indent: 30px;">★★★★☆</p>
