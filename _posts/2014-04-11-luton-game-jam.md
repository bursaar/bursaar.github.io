<p>This weekend I&#39;m attending the <a href="https://www.train2game.com/">Train2Game</a> <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-19622596">Game Jam in Luton</a>. It&#39;s a 48 hour event kicking off this afternoon at 6pm and finishing at 6pm on Sunday. The idea is to make a computer game from scratch in that time. I&#39;ve been to a couple of these before; only one of which was a full-on computer game jam, and even that one was only 12 hours. This&#39;ll be my first time attending an event like this with my newfound (but still undeveloped) programming skills.
<p><br>
<p>I&#39;m part of a six-man team called Rusty Spoons, I&#39;m not sure what we&#39;re going to be developing yet, but I&#39;ll be posting about my experiences. Any techie revelations will be over <a href="https://ben.ie/blog" target="_blank" title="">on my personal blog</a>.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">Wish me luck!</span></p></p>
