<p>My good friend Terence gave me a lend of his 350D for close to a year before I managed to buy my own camera, a favour I won't forget! I went out to <a href="https://www.birdweb.net/bullisland.html" target="_blank">Bull Island</a> with Richard and his girlfriend Lisa, a year and a day ago today.</p>
