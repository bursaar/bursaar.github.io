<p><i>iPad: €4.49, iTunes App Store</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 30px;" data-mce-style="text-indent: 30px;">Boasting 90 playable characters from the Marvel universe, there is something here for fans, but in all of the meetings that must have taken place between the executives at Lego and Disney/Marvel, all the talk of demographic crossover and amortisation of royalties in lieu, it feels like nobody took the time to talk about what the game would actually be like.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30px;" data-mce-style="text-indent: 30px;">In theory, having Mavel’s superheroes fighting in a Lego game makes sense, and the console versions of this same game have been very well-received, but the iPad port is deeply sloppy and disappointing. Framed as an arcade-style game, the controls are unresponsive and imprecise, making combat unsatisfying, and the disposable one- to two-minute cutscenes don’t feel practical on a mobile device.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30px;" data-mce-style="text-indent: 30px;">★★☆☆☆</p>
