<p>This is one of our first “B-Sides”, a personal challenge to write, shoot, finish and publish a short in one day. On this first day, we produced three B-Sides, Rory’s Friend, Pat-a-Cake for Men and <a href="https://youtu.be/eqybrtHhtsw" target="_blank">Don’t Frape</a>. Though it’s been a bit of a divisive piece, I love this sketch, it’s one of my favourites. The surreality and sense of escalating madness makes me smile.</p>
