<p>I'm working on a couple of tiny personal projects at the moment. The handiest way to play them is of course on the Steam Deck, but getting builds onto it without setting up a Steam store product has been a little impenetrable, until now.</p>

<p>After following a <a href="https://foosel.net/til/how-to-add-itchio-games-to-the-steamdeck">helpful guide</a> on installing Itch.io on the Steam Deck, I've been able to use a <a href="https://github.com/WispBart/ButlerWindow">handy little Unity Package</a> to deploy directly to Itch.io from the editor – which now lets me play those builds on the deck, complete with auto-updating.</p>
