<p>A game that I worked on when I was interning for Snozbot, I'm still participating in active development.Â It's been a pleasure and an honour to work on the team, the others being Chris Gregan, Jason Farrell and Terry Kenny.</p>
<blockquote><p>Set on Snozbot Farms a few nights before Christmas, farmer Snozbot is woken from a fitful sleep by a terrible noise...</p></blockquote>
<p>A demo is available to view at a private link, please <a href="mailto:ben@ben.ie" target="_blank">contact me</a> to take a look.</p>
<p>My work on the project has been mostly creative, writing dialogue and flavour text, designing puzzles and helping to develop the storyline. I've also written a lot of scripts to handle the scenes and logic, and I've written some custom classes to control things like sprites, animation and audio.</p>
