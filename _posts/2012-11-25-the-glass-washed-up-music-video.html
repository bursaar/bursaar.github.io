<p>This is a music video for a NYC/Berlin band <em>The Glass.</em> We didn't have much time or any money, so we kept it simple, intercutting between the rehearsals and the live performance. This track is grungy and dirty, so we kept the blocking as dance-friendly as the music. This is a companion piece to the other, gentler piece <em><a title="The Glass – Wannabe Dancing [Music Video]" href="http://blog.ben.ie/video/the-glass-wannabe-dancing-music-video/">Wanna Be Dancing</a>.</em></p>
