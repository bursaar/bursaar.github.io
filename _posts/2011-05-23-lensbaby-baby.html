<p>Before my gear was nicked, I was the proud owner of a <a href="https://lensbaby.com/#2" target="_blank">lensbaby</a>, a lovely little bit of plastic, metal and glass, great for a bit of fun. My friend Richard was in a band called The Wire (which has long since disbanded) and they had Renée, a guest vocalist, on for a charity gig they were doing.</p>

<p>These are some of the lensbaby shots I got with her and the others:</p>
