<p>Whether you have a favourite Starfleet captain or couldn’t tell a Klingon from a Kardashian, <em>FTL: Advanced Edition</em> is still probably for you. A game designed to simulate what it’s like being the captain of a spaceship, constantly thinking on your feet, it’s unrelentingly difficult, but in a way that makes every hard-won victory all the sweeter.</p>
<p>Created in 2012 by two independent game developers, this retro-looking 2D game became huge on PC and Mac, so huge that they spent the last two years creating the <em>Advanced Edition </em>DLC (downloadable content) – a massive, free update to the game that brings interface refinements, new ships, new systems and new mechanics. They also released a full and perfect port on iPad that is, quite frankly, the way the game is meant to be played. It’s rare to see a game you can happily dip into for two minutes or two hours and still be satisfied, but this is something special.</p>
