  content: This is a common glitch, it typically works if you can keep the Window
    flat against the wall. This way when you go through, there is no where to go,
    but out.

  content: Make sure its put right up against a wall or it wont work. If it still
    isnt working, press r. Try to get it to work. The levels after that are amazing.

  content: I glitched it by moving the picture frame while standing in it.. It might
    help also if you kinda let the side of the frame hit you.. You also might need
    to stand on the right side BEHIND it. If it doesn't work, then idk, but I did
    it :D

<p>One of the most exciting things about games is that it's all so new that huge, astonishing leaps ahead are if not common, then at least reasonably frequent.<span style="line-height: 1.3em;"><em>Museum of Simulation Technology</em><span style="line-height: 1.3em;"> is a new game demo from <a title="" href="https://pillowcastlegames.com/" target="_blank">Pillow Castle Games</a>, a five-student team from Carnegie Mellon University.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.3em;"><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">The demo is showing off the core concept of forced perspective behind <em>Museum of Simulation Technology,</em> which has to be seen to be believed.</span></span></p>
