<p>Part of Half a Giraffe's 5 second films series, this one kicked it off. Gemma came up with the idea and we shot it while Ciaran was over from Canada.</p>
<p>Along with our Hardback sketch, this was an early experiment with the running time of 5 seconds. It turns out that writing for 5 seconds is tough, but not as tough as you'd think. I reckon the last few years of sketch-making have been good to us.</p>
