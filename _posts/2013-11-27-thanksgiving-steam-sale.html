<p>No mercy.</p>
<p>None.</p>
<p>There's another mega sale over on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com" target="_blank">Steam</a>. Highlights include <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/72850/" target="_blank"><em>Skyrim</em></a> at 75% off (€7.50), <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/202170/" target="_blank"><em>Sleeping Dogs</em></a> at 80% off (€5) and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/241600/" target="_blank"><em>Rogue Legacy</em></a> at 66% off (€4.75). You'd be stupid not to buy them. That's what I'll be telling my bank manager.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, your money is not safe. No point in hiding it, just give it all to charity. I think I finally bought <em>Skyrim</em>. I'm not sure why I did it.</p>
