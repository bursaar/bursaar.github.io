<p style="text-align: left;">If you're interesting in seeing what a game studio looks like from the inside, I'd recommend taking <a href="https://digitgaming.com/play-testers-wanted/?utm_source=hootsuite&amp;utm_campaign=hootsuite" target="_blank">a look at this page</a> and sending over a C.V. I had the good fortune to put in a few days of testing at Digit Game Studios a couple of months ago and I found the process enjoyable and really valuable. They're a lovely bunch of people, and as long as you were respectful of their time and space, very generous with information and advice.</p>
