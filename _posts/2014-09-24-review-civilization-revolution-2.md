<p>Based on the critically acclaimed (and hugely successful) turn-based <i>Civilization</i> series for PC and Mac, the first <i>Revolution</i> game released on consoles and mobile platforms in 2008 was an interesting achievement at the time. Nobody had tried to condense such a complex game about exploration and strategy to mobile before, and while they did an admirable job, the effort seems quaint by today’s sophisticated standards.</p>
<p>This latest iteration is much more graphically ambitious, and brings some new depth to the simplified format, while keeping the playtime for an empire-building campaign prudently short; around an hour in our experience. Also worth noting is the commendable decision to avoid free-to-play mechanics, striving instead to be worth the once-off asking price.</p>
