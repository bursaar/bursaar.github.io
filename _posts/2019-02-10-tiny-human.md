Ola friends,

We're just beginning to come up for air after welcoming a tiny new person into the world: Ari was born on August 5th here in Lisbon (or, to be more precise, across the water in Almada) and we've spent the last ~~two and a bit five~~ six months getting to know him, changing nappies, learning how to breastfeed and eating a lot of dinners from the nuclear baby bunker (aka the chest freezer we so lovingly crammed with grub in the weeks before he arrived). 

For the first few weeks, we didn't wander much farther than our own neighbourhood, which is Campolide. It was a nice excuse to get to know it better, and there was plenty here to keep us occupied: A Valenciana, a yum, traditional churrascuria with divine barbecued chicken, LucDuc, our favourite ice cream place, the Amoreiras kiosk (where the fabulous Sofia Hoffmann dedicated a gorgeous cover of What a Wonderful World to Ari), with its yum almond tarts, the cool, echoey M√£e d'√Ågua (an 18th-century reservoir) and, for the odd trip to meet visiting friends, the sweet 24e tram. 

We've also started a lovely new Friday ritual that lets us take advantage of Lisbon's kiosks. For the past few Fridays, we pop Ari in the wrap and head to our local kiosk for fresh croissants, freshly squeezed OJ and a couple of coffees (the bill is around ‚Ç¨5). It's a nice way to reflect on the week.

One of our first trips out with Ari was for Ben's birthday back in September: We headed to Belem for an amazing picnic, put together by the Wine with a View crowd. Nathalie's blogged about the experience here. 

Now that Ari is a bit older (~~two and a bit months~~ six monthsü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è), we've started venturing out a bit more. We've recently started working our way around S√£o Bento. It's a cute little 'hood, near Principe Real and packed with vintage and antique shops. Ben discovered an Austrian sausage place he loved; it's on the same corner as a tasty Italian hole-in-the-wall that does pizza by the slice and just up the road from Landeau, who do the best chocolate cake in the city/country/world. So good thing the walk home is 25 minutes uphill üòÇ

Speaking of exploring, if you're thinking of coming to Lisbon with a little one we strongly suggest babywearing ‚Äì those hills are killer at the best of times, but add in uneven cobbled streets, teeny lifts and narrow staircases and it becomes clear why this city and prams don't mix well. 

We wear Ari basically everywhere, using a combination of wraps, a ring sling and an Ergobaby. He loves looking around, taking everything in, smiling at strangers. Ben regularly gets followed around by tiny old ladies cooing and mooning up at them both.

Okay! Bit of an epic catch up email, but we're up to speed now, right? If you're planning a trip to Lisbon, definitely hit us up. We're no longer able to party past 7pm but that doesn't mean we're no craic ;) 

We'll be back in Dublin early March for Nathalie to do some shooting, would love to see some of you.

Bye for now,
- Nathalie, Ben & Ari
