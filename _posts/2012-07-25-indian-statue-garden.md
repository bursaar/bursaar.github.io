    Great pictures Ben.  Very striking.  

    (I like your Tag : Gigantic Vagina... if people come here after searching for that they might be a bit disappointed.)

<p>A month or so ago I visited <a href="https://www.victoriasway.eu/about-P.htm" target="_blank">The Indian Statue Park</a> and walked <a href="https://www.victoriasway.eu/about_V.htm" target="_blank">Victoria's Way</a> with some friends, a bizarre patch of Eastern culture with a tech twist in the middle of Co. Wicklow.</p>
<p>Passing a plaque dedicating the park to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_turing" target="_blank">Alan Turing</a>, you enter the park along a "Birth Canal" (ahem).</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="2012,  - 01 of 08.jpg" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7134/7636121072_0e0aeb8b5d_b.jpg" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Here there's a large green area with a selection of statues in various poses.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="2012,  - 02 of 08.jpg" src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8285/7636121780_1f5d763d32_b.jpg" /></p>
<p>You can then enter Victoria's Way, an almost hidden path through the forest, which comes out into clearings featuring very large sculptures. They are all evocative, some of them more striking than others.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="2012,  - 03 of 08.jpg" src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8290/7636122912_fc356651e2_b.jpg" /></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="2012,  - 04 of 08.jpg" src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8023/7636147852_3461f0c41c_b.jpg" /></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="2012,  - 05 of 08.jpg" src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8428/7636156674_9b68433937_b.jpg" /></p>

<p>The clearings provided oases - quiet spaces where we reflected on the imagery without really intending to.</p>
<p>The park is easily accessible from Roundwood, cheap to get into and well worth a wander.<a href="https://blog.ben.ie/?p=1532"> I went back again</a> a few weeks later with some friends and a macro lens on loan from <a href="https://nathalie.ie/blog" target="_blank">Nathalie</a>.</p>
