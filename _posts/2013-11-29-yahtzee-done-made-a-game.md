<p>Good news! Ben "Yahtzee" Crowshaw has made a game. If you don't know who he is, then you are in for a treat. He keeps a rightly successful video blog called Zero Punctuation over on The Escapist, a well-known Australian gaming magazine and website.</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/4wgQvij3rVE" height="326" width="580" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>As well as being truly, truly funny, he's got a very good critical eye and insight, so whether this game is good or bad, it'll probably be interesting.</p>
<p>His game is called <em>The Consuming Shadow</em>, a rogue-like procedurally-generated side-on action survival horror dungeon crawler with sanity mechanics, RPG features and permadeath. Bit of a smorgasbord of features there, but nobody can accuse him of being slack with ideas.</p>
<p>His release is a beta, and for now at least, totally free. So if you have easy access to a Windows machine you should do yourself a favour and swing by <a href="https://www.fullyramblomatic.com/conshadow/" target="_blank">his site</a> to pick it up.</p>
