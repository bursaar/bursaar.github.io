<p>You like to laugh, right? You like computer games – or, for the Americans among you, video games – right? Well, then you're going to love The Besties. The podcast launched alongside <a href="https://polygon.com" target="_blank">Polygon</a>, featuring <a href="https://www.polygon.com/users/JustinMcElroy" target="_blank">Justin McElroy</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/users/griffinmcelroy" target="_blank">Griffin McElroy</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/users/ctplante" target="_blank">Chris Plante</a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/users/RussFrushtick" target="_blank">Russ Frushtick</a> talking each week about the best things.</p>

<p>Well, right now it's the best things. For a while they would pitch their favourite game at one another and vote. Then for a while they would pitch their favourite game to their boss and he'd vote. Then for a bit it was just talking, I think. It may sound like a mess, and I guess it is a mess, but it's an endlessly fun one. Griffin and Justin McElroy are veterans from another one of my favourite non-gaming podcasts; <a href="https://maximumfun.org/shows/my-brother-my-brother-and-me" target="_blank">My Brother, My Brother and Me</a> (aka MBMBaM), and Russ and Chris more than hold their own.</p>

<p>Though the above shots are from a video special, the podcast almost always arrives in audio-only form, and drops on Friday afternoons, GMT. The guys are all legitimately funny, and have a deep critical understanding of computer games; their commentary is almost always insightful and worth listening to.</p>
