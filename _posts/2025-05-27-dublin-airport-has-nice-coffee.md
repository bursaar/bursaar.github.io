I do a bit of travelling for work these days, and was recently flying out of Dublin Airport and spotted a Cloud Picker caf√©!

It even has a notiony water spout, I guess?

And of course it's The Airport, so prices are extreme, and you can get drunk there. I was standing there at a bleary 5:45am (having been up for hours already) and stuck to the excellent coffee.
