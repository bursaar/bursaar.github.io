<p><em>Barry’s Bespoke Bakery</em> is a project I produced with Denis McArdle, and is my first <a href="https://irishfilmboard.com/" target="_blank">Irish Film Board</a>-funded short project. The film is about two bakers with antithetical personalities clashing over the making of an ornate and complex cake. The film premiered at the Galway Film Fleadh in July 2012. <a href="https://barrysfilm.com/" target="_blank">Official Website</a> | <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2234878/" target="_blank">IMDb Entry</a> | <a href="https://press.barrysfilm.com/" target="_blank">Presskit</a></p>
