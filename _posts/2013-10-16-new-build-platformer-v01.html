<p>I've uploaded the first build of a very simple platformer I'm working on. It's so simple it's just some platforms, a player character and a basic control scheme (left, right, up/space)</p>
<p>This step is to get a feel for how tweaking the parameters for speed and gravity affect the level design – changing the distances that mean the difference between a platform you can jump onto and a platform you can't. It's also for figuring out the best way to make the rules of the game world work for collisions and solidity.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Right now there's only one level, and not much to do, but it's worth seeing the first stage.</p>
