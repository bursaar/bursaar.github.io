<p>[dropcap]I[/dropcap] don't really write about music or podcasts, but I was talking with a friend about <a href="https://99percentinvisible.org/post/25099083612/episode-56-frozen-music" target="_blank">this episode</a> of 99% Invisible and thought I'd share it with all y'all. The podcast is about the 99% of great design that is completely invisible, and how that shapes our world and our lives, the topics range from airport crowd-control systems to political rallies and in this episode, music recording.</p>
<p>Jon Brion, who composed music for Paul Thomas Anderson and Michel Gondry, talks about the distinction between a song as a piece of written music, and a performance piece, as a recording.</p>
<p>It's only ten minutes long, but really interesting. If you enjoy it, check out some of the other episodes over on <a href="https://99percentinvisible.org/" target="_blank">https://99percentinvisible.org/</a></p>
