<p>The creators of <i>Goat Simulator</i> are here to remind you not to take anything too seriously as you pilot your violent, indestructible goat to create maximum mayhem. It sounds ridiculous because it is.</p>
<p>The game’s single level looks like a sandbox-style world, but it’s more like a playground, or a toy, always tracked by the game’s exhaustive achievement system. Once you’ve gotten the basic fun stuff out of the way, like head-butting humans into each other and blowing up cars, you can start to mix it up for high score combos, kicking things until they explode, using your goat’s sticky tongue to grab and fling furniture/debris/people at whatever you like. The arena is also packed with easter-eggs and fun surprises, rewarding you for the most bizarre accomplishments.</p>
