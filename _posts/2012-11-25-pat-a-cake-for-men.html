<p>We came up with this one while we were making the other short pieces – I wasn’t sure it would work, but it’s proven to be one of our most popular sketches. It’s also an abject lesson in filmmaking, especially for the internet; the shorter the better. This was made as part of our first B-Sides programme, as per Rory’s Friend, the first sketch on this page.</p>
