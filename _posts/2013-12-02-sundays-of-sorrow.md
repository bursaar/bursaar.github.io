<p style="text-align: left;">The story of Maria, a woman who was displaced several times throughout Medallin, one of Colombia's largest cities.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I worked on this film for <a href="https://trocaire.org" target="_blank">Trócaire</a>, made on the same trip as the <a title="Cacquetá" href="https://ben.ie/video/cacqueta/">Cacquetá</a> video. Shot, edited and directed by myself. Produced by <a href="https://twitter.com/erice" target="_blank">Eoghan Rice</a>.</p>
