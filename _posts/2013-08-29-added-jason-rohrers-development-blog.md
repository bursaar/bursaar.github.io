<p>I've updated the blog roll in the sidebar with a link to Jason Rohrer's <a href="https://thecastledoctrine.net/news.php" target="_blank">news page</a> for his game <a href="https://thecastledoctrine.net" target="_blank">The Castle Doctrine</a>. It's technically just news about his work on it, but it's really more like a development blog. If you're familiar at all with the game, roll back to one of his <a href="https://thecastledoctrine.net/seedBlogs.php?action=show_archive&amp;blog_name=news&amp;order=1&amp;count=10&amp;show_authors=1&amp;show_dates=1&amp;offset=15&amp;show_intro=1&amp;show_submit_link_to_public=0" target="_blank">earliest entries</a> and follow his thought process, it's really fascinating to see him fix, balance and tune gameplay. His solutions to cheating, exploits, fundamental gameplay issues are all elegant and clever, even when they don't work. He's on version 17 at the moment, and it's still getting better.</p>
