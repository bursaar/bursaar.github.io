<p>I came across these this morning and thought they'd be worth a look. This was a TV series created by <a href="https://www.emmettjscanlan.com/" target="_blank">Emmett Scanlan</a> that he approached me to direct a few years ago for <a href="https://www.rte.ie/storyland" target="_blank">Storyland</a>.</p>
<p>First, we made a thirty second pitch (above).Â We were fortunate enough to be selected for an interview, so we shot a few character scenes to clarify the style of the comedy and delivery since Emmett would be in the US shooting MTV series <a href="https://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2009/04/the-phonehttpwwwmtvcomontvdynthe_phoneseriesjhtml-a-new-reality-show-premiering-tonight-on-mtv-is-a-treasure-hu.html" target="_blank">The Phone</a> when we were scheduled to interview and we figured his presence would be missed.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><object width="580" height="465" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="https://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/nDhagNMJ2oM?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed width="580" height="465" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="https://www.youtube.com/v/nDhagNMJ2oM?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US" allowFullScreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" /></object></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Though the clip is deliberately short, we shot about half an hour of material, which was a lot of fun. Emmett and I worked together first on a <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1581644/" target="_blank">feature film</a> I directed in fits and spurts between 2004 and 2007 and The Agency was going to be made in that style; with a carefully developed script, heavily embellished with improvisation.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Sadly, we didn't get selected (though another series I pitched did), but Emmett came on board for the first <a href="https://www.halfagiraffe.tv" target="_blank">Half a Giraffe</a> sketch a couple of years later.</p>
