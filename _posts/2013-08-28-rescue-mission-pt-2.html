Man, I bet Dufus or whatever his name is is glad to be on board where he&#39;s nice and safe. Himself and Rolin have a kushy ride home.<br></p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><span style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img src="https://thenorobotsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/wpid-Photo-14-Aug-2013-0153.jpg" id="blogsy-1377535331906.5989" class="aligncenter" alt="" width="580" height="362"></span></div>

I bet they totally forgot about this guy:</p>

<p>They settle into their metal seats in zero-G without seatbelts or anything and don&#39;t seem to notice that I was a little cavalier with the fuel on the way in. In fact, none of us seem to have noticed. Not even me.</p>
<p>Instead of panicking about that, I just get down to the business of circularising our orbit and setting sail for home.<br></p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><span style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img src="https://thenorobotsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/wpid-Photo-14-Aug-2013-0111.jpg" id="blogsy-1377535331906.9055" class="aligncenter" alt="" width="580" height="362"></span></div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><span style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img src="https://thenorobotsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/wpid-Photo-14-Aug-2013-0149.jpg" id="blogsy-1377535331824.4104" class="aligncenter" alt="" width="580" height="362"></span></div>
<p><br><br />
We run into problems about, I&#39;d say, 9% of the way through. I make a series of bad calls that waste the paltry amount of fuel we had after the bad calls I made on the way in. It&#39;s a management issue, really.</p>
<p>This is the closest we get to Kerbal:<br></p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><span style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img src="https://thenorobotsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/wpid-Photo-14-Aug-2013-0200.jpg" id="blogsy-1377535331908.1182" class="aligncenter" alt="" width="580" height="362"></span></div>
<p><br><br />
My fly skill lands us in a steeply elliptical orbit, getting this close, and then swinging out to here.<br></p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><span style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img src="https://thenorobotsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/wpid-Photo-14-Aug-2013-02001.jpg" id="blogsy-1377535331847.138" class="aligncenter" alt="" width="580" height="362"></span></div>
<div class="separator" style="text-align: left; clear: both;">Turns out you can&#39;t do a bloody thing out in space without fuel, except spin around like a tool, and even that is probably pushing it.</div>
<div class="separator" style="text-align: left; clear: both;">This is the point most people give up. I&#39;m not most people. I&#39;m in a very small percentile. I&#39;m a risk-taker. Some would say a visionary (most don&#39;t). Poor wee Donbus spent weeks on Minmus, alone in the cold with only a flag to keep him company. Now, sitting in the capsule, with only Rolin to keep him company, a marginal improvement, he deserves to get home safely. I built the capsule to survive re-entry, which is to say I stuck a parachute on it, so as long as he stays inside it he should be ok.</div>
<div class="separator" style="text-align: left; clear: both;">To this end, I shove Rolin out the door and try to alter our orbit by using his jet pack. This has a positive and negative effect, neither of which have to do with our orbit.</div>
<div class="separator" style="text-align: left; clear: both;">The good news is that Rolin gets to go home.</div>
<div class="separator" style="text-align: left; clear: both;">The bad news is that it&#39;s like this:</div>
