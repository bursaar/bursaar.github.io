<p>Jason Rohrer, game designer and conceptual artist extraordinaire has done something quite interesting to celebrate his latest game <em><a href="https://thecastledoctrine.net/buy.php">The Castle Doctrine</a></em> being made available on Steam; until Monday afternoon the in-game money you steal and manage to hold onto will be translated into real money, payable to a paypal account associated with your registered email address. The top eight players will also be able to get their favourite piece of art from their plundered collection printed and mounted in real life. He&#39;s put up <a href="https://thecastledoctrine.net/stealRealMoneyContest.php" target="_self" title="">details for the competition here</a>. It&#39;s also the last week of the current beta discount of 50%, so it&#39;s priced at $8, then it&#39;ll go up to $12 (25% discount) for the first week of launch on Steam and then up to its permanent price of $16. Until it goes up on Steam you can buy it <a href="https://thecastledoctrine.net/buy.php">here</a>. </p>
