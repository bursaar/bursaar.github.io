  content: Dammit Ben. I've been avoiding another time sink since KSP was eating up
    my time with not quite circular orbits and failed transfers to the Mun. Now I'm
    gonna try this. Seeya later sleep, you're overrated anyway!

  content: Ha! My feelings exactly! It's not as polished or deep as KSP, so I predict
    you will return to KSP some day soon (especially as they announced they're bringing
    in science modules, research and tech trees in the next update!).

<p>Research is a hazardous thing. The great thing about blogging is that it gives me even more of a reason to buy and try new games. The terrible thing about it is what it does to my general productivity. I&#39;ve been hearing a lot about <em><a href="https://www.introversion.co.uk/prisonarchitect/">Prison Architect</a></em> from <a href="https://www.introversion.co.uk/prisonarchitect/">Introversion</a>, a small but very cool indie dev company in the UK. It&#39;s in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/earlyaccessfaq/">Early Access</a> at the moment, the same financing model used by <em><a title="" href="https://minecraft.net" target="_self">Minecraft</a></em>, <em><a title="" href="https://thecastledoctrine.net/about.php" target="_blank">The Castle Doctrine</a></em> and <em><a href="https://kerbalspaceprogram.com/">Kerbal Space Program</a></em>, giving you early buy-in to the alpha, playing the game before it&#39;s finished.<br></p>

You may have noticed a bit of a gap in my blogging schedule. Sorry about that. Turns out <em>Prison Architect</em> is deeply addicting and a lot of fun, stay-up-until-3am-even-though-I-have-stuff-to-do-tomorrow kind of fun. I&#39;m wrestling with my compulsion to play it at the moment and hope to be back to normal soon.</p>
