I've been writing a story for, and kind of with, Ari for the last few months. Some evenings at bedtime I'll make up the next part, and it's been really fun. I had been enjoying some of the ideas we're kind of walking towards, and when Ari one night said "Dad you should put these together into a book" I had to smile because I'd been thinking the same thing.

I'm going to write them up, piece by piece, and post them here. Not to really publish, but just to make them real. In time, I may edit them, iterate on them, expand on them and put them together into something that some people could reasonably agree should be called a book. 

Until then, you can click on the ["Door in the Dressing Gown"](/door-in-the-dressing-gown/) tab in the sidebar and that'll take you to all the stories, collated together into a single page. Maybe some day that page'll be huge, though at time of writing, there're only two chapters. Barely more than a day's worth of NaNoWriMo.

Anyway, please enjoy! Any questions or feedback, please [reach out](ben@ben.ie).
