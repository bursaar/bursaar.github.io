<p>[dropcap]A[/dropcap] <del>little</del> month late, here's some background on 2012, the video I made with the wonderful Nathalie about our year together. We shot this on our 5D Mark IIs and the 16mm-style footage was shot by Nathalie on an iPhone 4S. She has some <a href="http://nathalie.ie/blog/2012/12/31/exploring-2012/" target="_blank">wonderful shots</a> from our trips over on her <a href="http://nathalie.ie/blog" target="_blank">blog</a>, which she recently revamped, so it's definitely worth a look.</p>
<p>We cut the video on Final Cut Pro X on my 13" MacBook Pro over three or four evenings with a strict deadline of midnight on New Year's Eve. We got it done by seven or so and headed out to dinner to ring in the new year, knowing our project was finished and live - a lovely feeling!</p>
<p>Like pretty much all of my video work, it's been <a title="Film &amp; Video Work" href="http://ben.ie/">added to my portfolio</a>.</p>
