<p>Yesterday I attended the Dublin <a href="https://www.dublintwinejam.com" target="_blank">Twine &amp; Jam</a>, an event held at the offices of <a href="https://www.sixminute.com/" target="_blank">SixMinute</a>, organised by <a href="https://alphachar.com/" target="_blank">Charlene</a>, <a href="https://www.dreamfeel.net/" target="_blank">Paul</a> and <a href="https://davetheallthing.com/" target="_blank">Dave</a>. I've played with <a href="https://twinery.org" target="_blank">Twine</a> before, but I haven't made a real go of writing a full story before.</p>
<p>If you haven't used Twine, it's a simple app for writing interactive stories. Even with basic use it's quite powerful, but if you delve a little deeper, you can put some <a href="https://scoutshonour.com/cowgirl/" target="_blank">very interesting twists</a> on your project.</p>
<p>I showed up at the event with too little sleep and too much hangover, so I decided to make use of my rough, rough state.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-5015 aligncenter" alt="Hung Over at Twine Jam" src="https://thenorobotsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Photo-on-24-11-2013-at-11.41-1024x682.jpg" width="580" height="386" /></p>
<p>The result was <a href="https://philome.la/bursaar/i-try-my-best" target="_blank">I Try My Best</a>, which I'd like to invite you to try out; I made an effort to make it quite game-like, so there are random events, strategic setups, even a basic UI. It's in a rough, unpolished state at the moment, and I have a couple of bugs to squash, but if you're interested in seeing a work in progress, please give it a go!</p>
<p>The other games at the jam were great, some of them really tickled me. You can find the full list <a href="https://www.dublintwinejam.com/the-games.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
