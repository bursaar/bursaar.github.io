<p>Boasting a total lack of in-app purchases, it’s refreshing to find a complete experience that scratches the same itch as games like <i>Candy Crush Saga </i>or <i>2048</i> (generally accepted as a rip-off of <i>Threes</i>) that won’t use underhanded tactics to take your money or your time.</p>
<p>One of the exceptional things about this game is that the mechanics and rules are truly original – this isn’t a clone of <i>Tetris</i> or <i>Bejewelled – </i>though if it looks familiar, you may have played one of the many copies that sprung up within days of it being released. That achievement is all the more impressive when you start playing, and then put it down several hours later, shaky and dehydrated. Almost endlessly replayable, gorgeously crafted and funny, this is more than just a waiting-room diversion.</p>
