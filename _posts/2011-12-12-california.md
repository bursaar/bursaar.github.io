<p>Very soon (SO SUPER SOON) I will be visiting the sunny state of California with <a href="https://www.nathalie.ie/blog" target="_blank">Nathalie</a>. It reminded me that I'd never really been through my shots properly since being in the States earlier in the year with <a href="https://shanewozere.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Shane</a> (who has a great photoblog you should check out). Looking through reminded me of the benefit of time - I saw so many shots I'd missed on the first edit. Kinda tempting to go back through all libraries and pick out some old shots.</p>
<p>We started off in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Monica" target="_blank">Santa Monica</a>, an uncommonly lovely part of LA.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7154/6469597585_2663072f79_z.jpg" alt="IMG_1953" width="640" height="480" /></p>
<p>Our hotel was right by the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_Beach" target="_blank">Muscle Beach</a>.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7023/6469332245_67df1a1a99_b.jpg" alt="_MG_2003 - Version 2" width="683" height="1024" /></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7161/6469322451_b986f3fa07_z.jpg" alt="_MG_2001" width="640" height="427" /></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7005/6469335591_92022a75b2_z.jpg" alt="_MG_2009 - Version 2" width="587" height="640" /></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7006/6469337789_8ffb678024_b.jpg" alt="_MG_2015 - Version 2" width="672" height="1024" /></p>

<p>We then headed into the belly of The Beast, LA itself and Hollywood.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7149/6469626891_b3214e60bb_z.jpg" alt="_MG_1983 - Version 2" width="640" height="427" /></p>

<p>Of course, LA is the home of a religion I am not mad about, but since it is so intrinsically mixed up with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Scientologists" target="_blank">celebrity and the film business</a>, I am still rather curious about Scientology.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7027/6469449311_813ca5bac9_z.jpg" alt="_MG_2199 - Version 2" width="640" height="248" /></p>
<p>We found ourselves outside this place:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7024/6469481401_89d2c8d09d_z.jpg" alt="_MG_2266 - Version 2" width="640" height="340" /></p>

<p>And of course, we ventured in. It was a decidedly creepy experience. It is also the site of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwTDvfjcUJU#t=7m47s" target="_blank">famous meltdown by BBC journalist John Sweeney</a> when making an episode of Panorama about Scientology.</p>
<p>We also indulged in taking in a little wildlife while we were there.</p>

<p>We then hit the open road North and got some real heartland America stuff, which is always great.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7143/6469527409_80b8abea50_z.jpg" alt="_MG_2408" width="640" height="427" /></p>
<p>While I was driving, Shane snapped these:</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7024/6469539923_92d75546ca_z.jpg" alt="_MG_2439 - Version 2" width="640" height="427" /></p>

<p>And of course, San Francisco was beautiful, and I didn't take nearly enough photo's. I plan to rectify that on my return.</p>
