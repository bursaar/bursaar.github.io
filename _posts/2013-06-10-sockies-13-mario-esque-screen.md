<p>This is another of the screens I created for the 2013 Social Media Awards. I used a lot of the artwork that Bord GÃ¡is had gotten made for the event in this animation to make it blend nicely with the very impressive backdrop they had created to go behind the stage. Along with the Wolfenstein screen, this one took a long time to render.</p>
