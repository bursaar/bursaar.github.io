<p>A gloriously-rendered futuristic 2D physics-based motorbike platformer. Yeah, that’s right, one of those. If you’re unfamiliar with the <em>Trials</em> series, this is not dissimilar to the motorbike stunts you can do in <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> games to get points and kudos. The entirety of <em>Trials Fusion</em> is driving, spinning or hopping across various ramps and platforms on your motorbike (or later, if you’re good, a quad bike). A simple premise, and at its heart a very simple game, but still fun.</p>
<p>While the game isn’t particularly original in design, narrative or execution, it’s very handsomely presented with abundant lens flares and big environmental scripted events. The physics system is also quite robust and the controls are very precise and responsive, bar the occasional bug. The later, trickier parts of the game would be more frustrating if not for the frequent and painless checkpoints, but this can mean hearing the same part of the superfluous story over and over again.</p>
