<p>The home of the iPod, iMac, iPad, Mac, MacBook, MacBook Pro, Mac Pro, iPhone, iMovie, iDVD, Final Cut Pro, iPhoto, Aperture and, fuck, lots and lots more, Apple Inc. in Cupertino in California is kind of a big deal. They've dominated the psychological landscape of technology for a very long time, and <a href="https://www.nathalie.ie/blog" target="_blank">Nathalie </a>and I have always been huge fans of their work and their late- and great founder Steve Jobs. Sadly we knew there was no chance he'd be around, but we still wanted to call in and see his old office as we passed his home town.</p>
<p>Cupertino is a weird little town - compared to nearby San Francisco, it's a parochial suburb. We expected Apple HQ, One Infinite Loop, to be in some kind of enclave, or perhaps housed in tremendous grounds covered in orange groves or circled by vineyards. Instead, we found it in a smaller, only slightly nicer version of <a href="https://maps.google.ie/maps?hl=en&amp;cp=11&amp;gs_id=3&amp;xhr=t&amp;q=sandyford+industrial+estate&amp;gs_upl=&amp;biw=1680&amp;bih=949&amp;ion=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.,cf.osb&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=0x486709086562e047:0x1800c7a937ea4ef0,Sandyford+Industrial+Estate,+Co.+Dublin&amp;gl=ie&amp;ei=HNQmT6TMIcSXhQf2mYSVBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=geocode_result&amp;ct=title&amp;resnum=1&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CCYQ8gEwAA" target="_blank">Sandyford Industrial Estate</a>, the buildings small and utilitarian.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we were travelling on a Bank Holiday, leaving San Francisco on the second of January, so the place was closed up. Otherwise, there's a visitor's centre and store for buying Apple merchandise.</p>
