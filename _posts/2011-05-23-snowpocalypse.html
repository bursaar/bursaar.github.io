<p style="text-align: left;">There were so many snowpocalypses the last 20 months or so in Ireland, it's hard to remember which one this was.</p>

<p>I didn't have my camera long when I shot this. The snow had just fallen and I wanted to try to capture it. I loved how manic the dog was, she was so exultant about the snow, loving everything about it and understanding nothing. I shot everything in monochrome because the sodium lamps are virtually monochromatic, giving off a very narrow spectrum of light, and there's almost no colour information when you shoot in colour. Sometimes this is fine, but I didn't want a screenful of yellow snow! I kept the cutting style of the video rough, unexpected cuts and lingering shots...I think the B&amp;W evoked a feeling of vintage home movies. The flash towards the end of the clip is actual lightening.</p>
<p>The music, for anyone wondering is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8zsE5zdlsQ" target="_blank">Shape of Things To Come</a> by <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0566970/" target="_blank">Bear McCreary</a>, composed for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlestar_Galactica_(2004_TV_series)" target="_blank">Battlestar Galactica</a>. It's worth listening to the whole piece since I just took the beginning. It finishes quite epically. The piece is a companion and conclusion piece to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSYPYq9D_No" target="_blank">Passacaglia</a> from the same TV show.</p>
