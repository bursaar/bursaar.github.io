<p>Ever wanted to be the bad guy?</p>
<p><em>Mayor Mayhem</em> is a tower defence-style game I was prototyping and co-designingÂ with the incredibly talented Simon Hudson of <a href="https://www.munstarstudios.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Munstar Studios</a>. A fascism-themed mobile romp through cities around the world.</p>
