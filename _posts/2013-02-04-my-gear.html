<p>If you've been wondering why things have been a little quiet here, I should mention that my gear was stolen while I was shooting a job in Colombia. They got my camera, lenses, cards, accessories, phone and laptop. I'm hoping they'll all be replaced soon, so I can get back up and running, and in the meantime I'm working on the footage I brought back from the trip. Thanks for checking in :-)</p>
