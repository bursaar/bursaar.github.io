<p>Created for <a href="https://cortechs.ie" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cortechs</a>, an Irish startup making brain-training games for children with ADHD and concentration issues, <em>Zip and The Misty Mountain</em> was a great project to work on. Working from a design document put together by <a href="https://owenllharris.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Owen Harris</a>, I was the sole programmer on my phase of the game, which was building the core mechanics, the foundational tech and the first two levels.</p>

<p>The game is a runner with platforming, but the twist is that the player wears an EEG headset which allows the game to monitor their relaxation and focus levels. The game rewards higher levels of both in different ways. We also added a section of the game the children can replay over and over to train up their abilities.</p>
