<p>HUZZAH! Three big updates dropped this week. In no particular order:</p>
<h3>Prison Architect</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-5237" alt="Prison Architect" src="assets/uploads/norobots/uploads/2014/04/ss5-1024x576.png" width="580" height="326" /></p>
<p>They've finally fixed the broken money system! Check out how that works (and what else they've been up to) here:</p>

Kerbal Space Program</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-5236" alt="Kerbal Space Program" src="assets/uploads/norobots/uploads/2014/04/Screen-Shot-2014-04-08-at-17.14.13-1024x640.png" width="580" height="362" /></p>
<p>Finally! The NASA-backed Asteroid Redirection Mission update has arrived to <em>Kerbal Space Program</em>. This brings a lot of UI refinements and, crucially, asteroids. If you have the postural fortitude, you can watch this entire live stream of Scott Manley attempting a mission.</p>

<h3>FTL: Advanced Edition</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-5238" alt="FTL: Faster Than Light Advanced Edition" src="assets/uploads/norobots/uploads/2014/04/Screen-Shot-2014-04-08-at-16.43.55-1024x561.png" width="580" height="317" /></p>
<p>Though I've always been a huge fan of playing this on my Mac, I picked up the iPad version of this game as soon as the update went live, and have to say that this is even better on iPad than it is on a full-size PC. The UI refinements are all very welcome and help to open up the gameplay, but the new species and mechanics really deepen the game and make for hours of fun.</p>
<p>It's not especially important, but I realised I was writing this up that <em>FTL</em> is the only title of the three mentioned that is officially released, whereas <em>Prison Architect</em> is in alpha, <em>Kerbal Space Program</em> is in beta, and both are in my library as part of the Steam Early Access program.</p>
