<p>I've mixed feelings about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_dynamic_range_imaging" target="_blank">HDR</a>; here are a couple of shots I took with two different schools of approach to this oft-maligned technique.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3557/5815350519_351e3d603f_z.jpg" alt="The Good Office" width="640" height="427" /></p>

<p>The former is high global contrast with a large radius...there are light and dark "halos" around areas of differing range. The latter is low global contrast, regular local contrast. I think the latter is the most naturalistic and preserves the most detail, whereas the first one feels like a more pronounced effect.</p>
<p>My concerns with HDR revolve around how it deals with information; sometimes you want as much information in the frame as possible, and sometimes it's about the artful destruction of information, causing the eye to fill in the gaps.</p>
