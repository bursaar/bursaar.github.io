<p>Ever wondered what <em><a href="https://minecraft.net" target="_blank">Minecraft</a></em> would look like in real life? Of course you have. Check out <em>Pixel Passion</em>, a video over on <a href="https://www.machinima.com" target="_blank">Machinima</a>Â of just such a thing. I enjoy most fan-made vids, and this one's particularly strong (though I'm not into the purple/pink <a href="https://hotlinemiami.com" target="_blank"><em>Hotline Miami</em></a> font).</p>
<p>I was particularly impressed by the location they chose for the opening shots; very <em>minecraft</em>-like.</p>
