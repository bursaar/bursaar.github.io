<p>I&#39;m not much of a programmer, but the guys behind <em><a href="http://thenorobotsblog.com/game/prison-architect/">Prison Architect</a></em> are clearly quite good at it. I&#39;ve been neck-deep in this thing for the last few days, and am loving just about everything about the game. </p>

<p>One of the great things about playing any early-access game in active development of course is the frequency of major updates, and the nice fellows over at <a href="http://introversion.co.uk/">Introversion</a> make up a <a href="http://m.youtube.com/#/user/IVSoftware?&desktop_uri=%2Fuser%2FIVSoftware">video to go with each alpha they release</a>. The latest at time of writing, alpha 13, introduces tunnels and anti-tunnel deterrents, which is cool. What is even cooler is seeing how they have built the AI to react systemically to how you build your prison.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The map of dynamically-calculated vectors is a brilliant way to route the tunnels, definitely something worth thinking about for any grid-based pathfinding. </p>
