<p>Previously on <em><a href="https://thenorobotsblog.com/section/regulars/mission-log/">Mission Log</a></em>: <a title="Rescue Mission: FFS" href="https://thenorobotsblog.com/rescue-mission-pt-3/">FFS</a></p>
<p>Read from the beginning: <a title="Rescue Mission: Initial Sit Rep" href="https://thenorobotsblog.com/rescue-mission_pt0/">Rescue Mission</a></p>
<p>A few weeks ago, I sent a trio of astro-kerbals to rescue this guy:</p>
<p><a href="assets/uploads/norobots/uploads/2013/08/Screen-Shot-2013-08-11-at-23.27.09.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4117" alt="Kerbal on Minimus" src="assets/uploads/norobots/uploads/2013/08/Screen-Shot-2013-08-11-at-23.27.09.png" width="374" height="465" /></a></p>
<p>His situation has improved a little, in that he is now nice and warm in a capsule...helplessly orbiting Kerban. The heroes who went to save him are also sitting in a nice warm capsule...stranded on the surface of Minmus.</p>

<p>As most rescue attempts go, it is lame, it's pretty lame. I put my hands up, that's on me. Sorry, lads.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, and this guy died high in the skies above Kerban:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-4511" alt="Kerbal Space Program" src="assets/uploads/norobots/uploads/2013/08/wpid-Photo-14-Aug-2013-0206-1024x640.jpg" width="580" height="362" /></p>
<p>Before I make this even worse, I need to work on myself, on my skills. While I am (basically) good enough at orbital stuff, I'm not much good at docking manoeuvres, so before I can get back to these guys, I'm taking some time to up-skill, developing my docking abilities, the plan being that I will build a ship to recover BOTH the original dude, stranded in orbit of Kerban, and his rescue party, now stranded on Minmus.</p>
<p>Before I build such a craft, I need to learn how to build and dock RCS-powered spaceships, and how to do orbital rendezvous. For the next couple of days, this is where I eat:</p>

<p>I'm creating a space station in orbit of the planet for refueling and storing Kerbals. I'm going to run the rescue attempt from here, with a large, fuel-rich ship equipped with a lander. What can go wrong, right?</p>
<p><em>To be continued...</em></p>
