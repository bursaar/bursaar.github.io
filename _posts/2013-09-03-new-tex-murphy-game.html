<p>If you've never played a <a href="https://texmurphy.com" target="_blank"><em>Tex Murphy</em></a> game, you are (kind of) missing out. They were a series of FMV games from the late '80s to the late '90s. FMV stands for Full Motion Video, which just mens that there were cutscenes rendered in video as opposed to the in-game engine. If that sounds a bit technical, it couldn't be less so:</p>

<p>Why am I talking about a series of games that looks so terrible? Well, for all of its shortcomings, the <em>Tex Murphy</em> series had a lot of wit and charm, and tried very hard to do something ambitious. It disappeared in the late '90s due, presumably, to a near-total lack of enthusiasm from the public.</p>
<p>Fast-forward fifteen years and the advent of Kickstarter and the growth of nostalgia for retro games have aligned to create <em>Tesla Effect: A Tex Murphy Adventure</em>, coming to PC &amp; Mac early 2014!</p>

<p>As you can see, the technology has gotten better, even if it has managed to retain its cheap, cheesy charm.</p>
<p>If you're curious about the older games, you can pick them up from <a href="https://GOG.com" target="_blank">GOG.com</a> for PC or Mac. They're great, but <span style="text-decoration: underline;">be warned</span>, the control scheme is very, very clunky and old-fashioned.</p>
