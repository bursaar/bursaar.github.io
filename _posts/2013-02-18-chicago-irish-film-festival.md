This has been a good week for having our work recognised; we've been accepted to the Chicago Irish Film Festival! Happy to announce that we'll be screening on the 6th of March 2013. I keep details of all upcoming screenings <a href="https://barrysfilm.com/screenings/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Also happy to say that we have a few more bits of good news yet to come this week.</p>
