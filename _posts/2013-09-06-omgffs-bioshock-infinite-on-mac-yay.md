<p>If you&#39;re a Mac user like me and love games, you&#39;re in luck! I played <em><a href="https://www.bioshockinfinite.com/?RET=&ag=true">BioShock Infinite</a></em> a few months ago when it came out, but had to install a demo of <a href="https://www.parallels.com/">Parallels</a> and an unregistered version of Windows, it was a total pain. I had issues after a couple of days and then switched to <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/ht1461">Boot Camp</a>, even more of a pain. I&#39;ve been thinking of playing it again, but my trials for Parallels and Windows have run out, and I really, really hate Boot Camp, so it was with great joy that I saw this in my Steam list:</p>

<p>The game is now available for Mac! One of the distinct advantages being that you don&#39;t need to subdivide your RAM between your Mac and the virtual machine you needed to run Windows to run the game. I&#39;ve nipped in and it&#39;s definitely faster and better-looking on my MacBook Pro than it was on Windows. </p>
<p>If you don&#39;t have it already, it&#39;s a brilliant game â€“ great story and writing, and the world design is really impressive. It&#39;s a rare game that&#39;s <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/bioshock-infinite">deserving of the hype</a>. </p>
