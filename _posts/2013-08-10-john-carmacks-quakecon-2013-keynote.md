<p>Don't you just love John Carmack? He's a skinny little towering titan millionaire super genius, and a <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/gaming/id-s-john-carmack-sings-praises-of-open-source-988021" target="_blank">nice guy</a> to boot. His latest keynote at QuakeCon before running off to join the team at Oculus as CTO is, as always, fascinating and dense. He participates in technology at a level of detail that would kill most people, and he loves to talk about his observations, conclusions and predictions.</p>

<p>Check out the below video â€“ and join the crowd in egging him on whenever he tries to chastise himself for spending too long on each topic. Be warned: make sure you're seated comfortably, it's a good two hours and forty-seven minutes long.</p>
