I can also announce this week that our film <a href="https://barrysfilm.com" target="_blank">Barry's Bespoke Bakery</a> has been accepted to the Belfast Film Festival. Details of the screening will be <a href="https://barrysfilm.com/screenings" target="_blank">available here</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>...please do come along and say hello...</p></blockquote>
<p>I haven't been to Belfast since I was under the age of ten, so I'm looking forward to heading up with <a href="https://nathalie.ie" target="_blank">Nathalie</a> and <a href="https://barrysfilm.com/about-the-film/directors-statement/" target="_blank">Denis</a> and spending some time at the festival. Are you going to be there? I hope you get to catch the film, and please do come along and say hello. I'd also love to hear any feedback you have on the film, so don't be shy!</p>
