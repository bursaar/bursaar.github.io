  excellent Shadowrun Returns for iOS, and got good news from the developer.

<p>If you&#39;ve been on the fence about picking up Harebrained Schemes&#39; Shadowrun Returns, I can near-wholeheartedly recommend the experience. It&#39;s a great game, brilliant flavour text and luscious environments with a nice blend of old-school feel and modern mechanics. The only sticking point is the ridiculous checkpoint system which is bad enough on PC, but totally impractical for iOS gaming. Having to leave the game to attend to real life for more than a couple of minutes will lose you sometimes up to half an hour&#39;s worth of gaming, which is especially toxic for such a tight narrative experience.</p>
<p>The good news is that the developer is working on a manual saving system:</p>

<p>Fingers crossed it comes soon, since it&#39;s the only thing currently stopping me from mainlining this game!</p>
