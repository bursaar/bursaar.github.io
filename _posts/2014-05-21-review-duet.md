<p>“Keep calm and avoid everything.” Easier said than done. <em>Duet</em> is as simple as it sounds, but don't let that fool you. More likely to elicit gasps of frustration than hisses of triumph, you are guaranteed both if you take the time to master its primitive interface. Beautifully built around perfect flow, the game has no loading screens, no buttons, no score, just two dots in a circle that you rotate by holding down either the left or the right of the screen.</p>
<p>What starts out as a simple dodge mechanic soon becomes about rhythm, memory and reflexes. Every failure leaves a mark on the course, so repeated errors quickly become apparent, driving you to improve. Given the ease with which you can pick it up get get sucked into a session, mobile is the perfect platform for this game, and the high-quality finish and hours of fun are well-worth the modest price tag.</p>
