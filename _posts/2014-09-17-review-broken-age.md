<p>Beautifully-written, hand-illustrated and animated, the first act of developer Doublefine’s <i>Broken Age</i> is a masterclass in storytelling. Written by Tim Schafer, the comic genius behind classics like <i>Day of The Tentacle</i> and <i>Grim Fandango</i>, the story begins with a choice – you’re presented with two characters seemingly totally separate; one on a futuristic spaceship, the other in a pastoral countryside. Tap on one and play through their story. Get stuck or curious and you can easily switch to the other. Both storylines have an unwholesome sheen of paradise with a sense of real darkness lurking underneath, the jokes getting better the darker it gets.</p>
<p>Featuring notable acting talent like Elijah Wood and Jack Black, it’s a pleasure to play, and sets up Act II (released later this year) nicely.</p>
