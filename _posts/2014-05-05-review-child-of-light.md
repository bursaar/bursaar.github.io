<p>A stunningly beautiful release, <em>Child of Light</em> is part platformer, part Japanese-style roleplaying game (RPG). The story follows Aurora, a young Austrian princess who wakes up in a strange land and has to find the sun, moon and stars so she can escape and return to her father.</p>
<p>While it may seem strange to play an RPG in two dimensions, where one can go only left or right, the gameplay is very well-thought-out and frequently inventive. Controlling both Aurora and her sprite companion with a thumbstick for each feels natural and makes exploring the gorgeously-drawn world more fluid and fun. The only big drawback of the game’s heritage is the turn-based combat, which allows for plenty of depth, but tends to slam the action to a standstill.</p>
<p>While not for everyone, any fans of deep <em>Final Fantasy VIII</em> or smooth indie hit <em>LIMBO</em> would find a lot to enjoy and marvel at.</p>
