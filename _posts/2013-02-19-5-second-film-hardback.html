<p>Yes, yes, I know - it's not a hardback book, but it is a way to work in an erection joke, an eternally welcome opportunity over at <a href="http://halfagiraffe.tv" target="_blank">Half a Giraffe</a>. This was another experiment, along with Paranormal Activity, that we did to explore the running time. This has quite a few edits of course, and we shot an angle in there that we didn't end up using.</p>
