<p>I would have posted sooner, but I've been too busy playing <a href="https://candybox2.net" target="_blank">Candy Box 2</a>.</p>
<p>If you haven't played the original <a href="https://candies.aniwey.net" target="_blank">CandyBox</a> before, <a title="Recommended: Candy Box" href="https://thenorobotsblog.com/recommended-candy-box/" target="_blank">go check out my recommendation here</a>. The new one is fancier, funnier, bigger and more clever than the last one, I highly recommend you get stuck in!</p>
<p>I've also more recently been totally absorbed in the very similar but rather prettier <a href="https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/" target="_blank">Cookie Clicker</a> which has been out for a month or so. That shit is bananas. You have to give it a whirl. Worth nothing that it will work on tablets and smartphones, but for that real insane clicking sensation, it's best played on a computer with a mouse or trackpad.</p>
<p>Go, grind!</p>
