<p>Myself and <a href="http://barrysfilm.com/about-the-film/directors-statement/" target="_blank">Denis</a> produced this for the <a href="http://uniquelydublin.ie" target="_blank">Uniquely Dublin</a> competition last week. The illustrations were created by <a href="http://www.metaldragon.net/index.html" target="_blank">Alan Lambert</a> and were animated by me! I also created the soundtrack. Denis wrote and directed the piece. The excellent cast were <a href="http://www.actorsandmovers.com/males/damien_devaney.html" target="_blank">Damien Devaney</a> as Charlie Pigeon and <a href="http://youngartistsmanagement.com/KianMurphy.html" target="_blank">Kian Murphy</a> as the boy. Many thanks to Nick McGinley and Vincent Lambe for all of the help putting together the cast. I wrote a <a title="Horse in The Hole" href="http://ben.ie/horse-in-the-hole/">post on the process over here</a>.</p>
