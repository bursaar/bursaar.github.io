<p>[intro]I went to see Joss Whedon's new film <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2094064/?ref_=fn_al_tt_2" target="_blank">Much Ado About Nothing</a> today, followed by a talk from the man himself. I came away feeling inspired, below are a few of the things <a href="https://nathalie.ie/blog" target="_blank">Nathalie</a> and I spoke about, that were rattling around in my head on the way home.[/intro]</p>
<p>[dropcap]1.[/dropcap] Character always comes first. Whether it's a douchebag in Much Ado About Nothing, or Hawkeye in The Avengers. I'm reminded of a great quote I heard from <a href="https://barrysfilm.com/about-the-film/directors-statement/" target="_blank">Denis</a>:Â [cite]What does he want, and why can't he?[/cite] Motivation is everything.</p>
<p>[dropcap]2.[/dropcap] Collaborate carefully. Joss made a point of saying that he worked with his friends, and that he picked those friends up as he went from project to project. He clearly worked hard to get them and to keep them, and he credits them with bringing a lot of ideas and energy to their projects.</p>
<p>[dropcap]3.[/dropcap] Make what you write. As he pointed out, these days there's no excuse for not constantly producing and writing your own material. I've been feeling quite itchy (no, not down there) lately to get out there and get making things again. I get this point completely.</p>
<p>[dropcap]4.[/dropcap] Don't be afraid to stay small. This crossed over with something Gabe Newell said on a podcast recently. Being small means you can be nimble and quick, and can leapfrog the competition. You don't need to be part of the machine, you can build and drive your own business around your own content.</p>
<p>[dropcap]5.[/dropcap] Be humble but confident. Joss was humble, eager to acknowledge the work of others and to make light of his efforts, but he wasn't falsely modest, or insincere. It's important to always stay real and connected to the reality of your successes and failures.</p>
