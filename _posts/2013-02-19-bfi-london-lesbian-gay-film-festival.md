<p>[dropcap]S[/dropcap]o, the little film that could, <a href="https://barrysfilm.com" target="_blank">Barry's Bespoke Bakery</a> has been accepted to another film festival! This begins its run in the LGBT film circuit, as there's a gay element to the story.</p>
<p>We're delighted to be screening at such a prestigious festival, and I hope anybody I know in London gets a chance to see it. Details of the screening are be available over on the <a href="https://barrysfilm.com/screenings" target="_blank">official website</a>, and if you haven't seen it already, please check out the trailer above.</p>
