<p>Probably my favourite podcast full stop, <a href="https://www.alifewellwasted.com" target="_blank">A Life Well Wasted</a> is a joy. Filled with dense edits and illuminating, engaging interviews, the host Robert Ashley will explore an oblique angle of computer games. There's an episode about cataloguing and archiving the emerging medium, another about pushing the medium forward with art games.</p>

<p>My only criticism of the podcast is that there aren't nearly enough episodes. That may sound like a joke quibble, but they're very time- and work-intensive, and Mr. Ashley Â has gone from releasing one every month or two, to every year or two. I don't begrudge him a moment of delay, as I'd rather they were good than quick, and I understand that I've never had to pay for the privilege of listening, though I did gladly buy myself one of the beautiful limited edition prints that accompanies each episode:</p>

<p>There are moments I've felt silly adding the ALWW feed to a new podcasting app or iOS device, but I've never regretted it. There's nothing like waking up to a surprise episode, out of nowhere.</p>
<p>Do yourself a favour, start any episode, and get lost in this world. The episode I've linked to above is Episode Three, which features an interview with everyone's favourite hippie, <a href="https://thecastledoctrine.net" target="_blank">Castle Doctrine</a> designer <a href="https://hcsoftware.sourceforge.net/jason-rohrer/" target="_blank">Jason Rohrer</a>, <a title="The Castle Doctrine" href="https://thenorobotsblog.com/castle-doctrine/">previously mentioned in this blog</a>.</p>
