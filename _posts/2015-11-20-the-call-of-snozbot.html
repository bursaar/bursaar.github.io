<p>An absurdly (and delightfully) short game from <a href="https://snozbot.com">Snozbot</a> as part of their wonderful <em>Spaaace Faaarm!</em> series. We put it together in just over a week, from inception to shippable game.</p>

<p>I had a lot of fun creating simple fish-swimming behaviours in this one and doing a bit of character animation. Props as always to Emmett Corrigan for the lovely art. <a href="https://snozbot.itch.io/the-call-of-snozbot">Check it out and play it for yourself</a>!</p>
