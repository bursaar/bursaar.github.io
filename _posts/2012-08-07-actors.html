<p>[dropcap]I[/dropcap]Â do get to know quite a few actors in my line of work. I've never taken official headshots, but I often can't help myself when I'm around an actor, I do tend to take their photo's. Here are a couple of great guys I've worked with over the years.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAl3-xrpXpU" target="_blank">Tim</a> is a wonderful actor, great fun and a tremendous voice-over artist.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">This was taken on the set of a piece we were working on together in 2006. <a href="http://vimeo.com/41426803" target="_blank">Cathal's</a> a really talented artist and has a great flair for improvisation. He brought a lot to the projects we worked on, can't recommend him highly enough.</p>
