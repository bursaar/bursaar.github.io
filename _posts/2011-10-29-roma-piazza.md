<p>While taking a break from the traipsing around the Tavasere district to let our iPhones get their table on:</p>

<p>We enjoyed some Limonade Naturelle - freshly squeezed lemon juice, with sugar, water and ice on the side for you to add to taste:</p>

<p>We then noticed a disturbance the other side of the Piazza:</p>

<p>And when we got there, discovered there was fun a-happening! A (probably) South African choir doing an impromptu performance!</p>
