<p>Yes, I realise it&#39;s not 1997, but do you realise that living without having played Dungeon Keeper is like living without having ever heard Shakespeare read aloud? It&#39;s a cold, desolate and lonely place without humour or wisdom. Dungeon Keeper was one of my favourite games growing up, and it&#39;s still absolutely brilliant. </p>
<p>I picked this up from <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/dungeon_keeper">Good Old Games</a>, even though I&#39;ve bought it at least twice in my life in disc form, but at least now it&#39;s guaranteed to work on Mac and PC without needing any annoying workarounds. </p>
<p>If you&#39;ve never seen it, it&#39;s a subversion of the old sword-swinging knights and nobles RPG, where instead of The Lord of the Land, you are a dirty, cruel master of darkness and torment, creating your den of pestilence under the good citizens of wherever. Created by God-game progenitor Peter Molyneux, it&#39;s expertly balanced, grim, grimy and funny. Think <em>The Sims</em> meets Tim Burton and <em>Se7en</em>. </p>
<p>I&#39;ve never managed to finish it, it gets properly difficult after about the two-thirds mark, but it&#39;s a lot of fun to try! If you have it, or are thinking of picking it up, <a href="mailto:ben@ben.ie" target="_self" title="">give me a holla</a> and we&#39;ll try a networked game.</p>
