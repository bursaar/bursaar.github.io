<p>Sony are opening the PS4 Rooms in Dublin in nine days on Wednesday the 20th, a week and a half before the PS4 itself launches on the 29th of November. The space will be kitted out with fifteen PS4s, and will offer you the chance to try <em>Knack, DRIVECLUB, Killzone: Shadowfall </em>and even <em>Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag</em><em>.</em></p>
<p>The exact location is at 10 St. Stephen's Green in a space above Il Posto Restaurant.</p>

<p>I'll definitely be checking it out to try out <em>Assassin's Creed IV </em>in particular, and of course the new controller. The PS4 Rooms will be open for you to come in until December 8th. The opening hours are:</p>
<p>Mon, Tues, Wed: 12-6pm<br />
Thurs, Fri: 12-9pm<br />
Sat: 12-7pm<br />
Sun: 2-6pm</p>
