<p>I'm not a big fan of doing portraits...I simply don't enjoy or understand the process of getting the best out of someone when you are sticking a camera in their face. Some people are brilliant at it, I am not one of them. I do grab shots now and then I kinda like.</p>

<p>I know it's a self-portrait, but I feel it's fair. When I'm taking a photo, for better or worse, I hide behind the camera. I strongly favour candid photography. The less of me they see, the better my photograph will be.</p>

<p>A good, old friend of mine, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAl3-xrpXpU" target="_blank">Tim Dillard</a>. I just snapped this as we walked, but being an actor, he somehow managed to make it look interesting.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2898307/" target="_blank">John McHale</a>, production designer extraordinaire loves his ice-cream, and he's a great sport about having a camera shoved in his face! I took this when we were working together on a short film called The Daughter of The Brotherhood. We had just come off the long, gruelling shoot for <a href="http://www.kisses.ie/Welcome.html" target="_blank">Kisses</a>, a wonderful feature film that was shot mostly at night, meaning it had been months since we'd had a meaningful relationship with daylight.</p>
