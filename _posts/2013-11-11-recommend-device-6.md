<p>If, like me, you love the idea of an adventure game, but aren't wild about the actual experience of playing them because they're usually ugly, boring, poorly-written flat experiences, than <a href="https://simogo.com/games/device6/" target="_blank"><em>Device 6</em></a> might just be for you, since it's none of those things. A new game from veteran iOS dev <a href="https://simogo.com" target="_blank">Simogo</a>, <em>Device 6</em> is a choose your own adventure game, but with beautiful writing and incredible production values. Branching choices aren't written as <strong>Go Left or Right?</strong>, but instead a sentence itself will branch and change orientation, necessitating rotating your device to keep up, making choices feel more human and less abstract.</p>

<p>The experience is also rich with multimedia content. You're even presented with a warning before you start playing:</p>

<p>As you scroll, you'll come across striking images and interactive clues and puzzles for you to puzzle over before you progress. I played it with <a href="https://nathalie.ie/blog">Nathalie</a> beside me and we filled a few pages with notes on two of the chapters as we were trying to figure out how to get by as haunting music played, with creepy disguised audio clues.</p>
