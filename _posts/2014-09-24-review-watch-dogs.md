<p>Announced almost two years ago and the subject of significant delays, <i>Watch Dogs</i> has, for better or worse, been the poster child for next-gen gaming, meant to usher in a new era of immersion and making the most of the newest technology. Does it succeed? Kind of.</p>
<p>A timely tale of surveillance and erosion of privacy, the most disappointing element is the story. Our protagonist is Aiden, yet another trenchcoat-wearing stone-faced antihero, devoid of personality or character development. Once you get past that shortcoming, however, the experience opens up to welcome evolutions and revolutions. The action sequences are more accurate and better-designed than we’ve come to expect from an open world game, but the real innovations are in the hacking and multiplayer systems – bold, fresh and fun.</p>
