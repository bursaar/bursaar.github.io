<p>The game is written in <a href="https://twinery.org/" target="_blank">Twine</a>, so it’s a game-like Choose Your Own Adventure story. Since I'm studying game development at the moment, I wanted to exercise my newfound coding confidence and stretch my design muscles, but I also wanted to make something that was in some way personal, even if it wasn’t <span style="text-decoration: underline;">about</span> me exactly, I wanted it to be definitively mine. I wrote the game as part of the <a href="https://www.dublintwinejam.com/" target="_blank">Dublin Twine &amp; Jam</a>.</p>
<p>Here's a video of the game in action:</p>

<p>This is a video showing off some of the features of my twine game I Try My Best. Created for the 2013 Dublin Twine &amp; Jam, it&#039;s about coaching an under confident dude through a party and trying to help him meet a nice girl.</p>
<p> You can play the game at bit.ly/itrymybest</p>

<p>Some points of note:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is a slightly dynamic headshot with a confidence level at the top of each page past a certain point in the story.</li>
<li>Each confidence level has a bank of random quotes that could be applicable to that frame of mind.</li>
<li>You will read the story very slightly differently (only one or two passages) depending on your gender and sexual orientation.</li>
<li>Though it is buggy, there is an adventure-game-style puzzle in the living room of the party.</li>
<li>There is a timing element established early in the story to set up a not-yet-implemented flirting mechanic later on, to keep the game exciting.</li>
</ul>
<p>I also posted a little about the game and some of the things I learned over on <a href="https://thenorobotsblog.com" target="_blank">No Robots</a>:</p>

<h3>Currently Working On:</h3>
<p>A design doc to tease out the rest of the story with the priority on flirting with the girl on the couch.</p>
