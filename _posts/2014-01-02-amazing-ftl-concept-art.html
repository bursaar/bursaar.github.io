<p>I'm a big fan of <em><a href="http://www.ftlgame.com" target="_blank">FTL</a></em> and spotted these amazing pieces of concept art recently by a concept artist named <a href="http://www.lutzwork.com" target="_blank">Martin Lutz</a>.</p>

<p>His evocative take on the top-down strategy game that normally looks like this:</p>

<p>...reminded me of the awesome work by the artists on display at the <a href="http://iam8bit.com/the-gallery/" target="_blank">IAM8BIT</a> gallery in L.A. mentioned in <a href="http://alifewellwasted.com/2009/08/31/episode-four-artists-fans-engineers/" target="_blank">A Life Well Wasted</a>.</p>

<p>My experience with early computer games probably mirrors your own; the graphics were so rudimentary and my imagination was so active that I ended up filling in the blanks, using the game as a jumping off point, more like the experience of reading a novel than watching a film. That's changed for the most part in modern games, with the exception of retro-styled darlings like <em>FTL</em>. Of course I may be wrong, the experience of playing games for a ten-year-old now may be even better than it was when I was ten, but my imagination isn't as malleable and impressionable now as it was then. I feel strongly that an important part of remaining creative is being unafraid to do silly things like imagine what it's like to hide behind a bulkhead when a boarding party arrives on your ship in <em>FTL, </em>or to think about what your nearest forest in <em>Minecraft</em> smells like.<i><br />
