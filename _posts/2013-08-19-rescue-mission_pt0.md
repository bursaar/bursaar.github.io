excerpt: I'm going to attempt the impossible (or at least the fairly difficult) -
  a rescue mission in Kerbal Space Program. Fasten your seatbelts. What's that? They
  were melted in the fire? No worries, just hang on to something.

<p>I play a lot of <a href="https://kerbalspaceprogram.com" target="_blank"><em>Kerbal Space Program</em></a>. Some would say too much, others, not enough. I'd say it's about right. I manage to wash and feed myself, so it can't be that bad.</p>
<p>Recently I knuckled down, shoved chores and responsibilities to one side and got serious about putting a kerbal on Minmus.</p>
<p>"WTF is a kurball?" you ask? Well, it's pronounced kerbal, and keep the swearing to a minimum please, I run a clean show here.</p>
<p>This is a kerbal:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4117" id="blogsy-1377535145867.874" alt="Kerbal on Minimus" src="assets/uploads/norobots/uploads/2013/08/Screen-Shot-2013-08-11-at-23.27.09.png" width="374" height="465" /></p>
<p>They are a benevolent, stupid race of adorable beings who show no signs of civilisation beyond their slightly successful space program, which I am somehow running. <em>Kerbal Space Program</em> is a game about building spacecraft and sending hapless kerbals to their doom, though the aim SEEMS to be minimising fatalities, the system isn't, like, super strict about that.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>My recent mission to Minmus – one of the moons of Kerban, their home planet – was a semi-success. I say semi, in that I managed to get there in one piece:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-4120" id="blogsy-1377535145855.909" alt="Kerbal on Minimus" src="assets/uploads/norobots/uploads/2013/08/Screen-Shot-2013-08-11-at-23.12.05.png" width="700" height="437" /></p>
<p>...but I also managed to destroy the craft by running out of fuel during takeoff, stranding our heroic* kerbal on the surface after a daring high-altitude ejection...</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-4121" id="blogsy-1377535145823.6155" alt="Stranded Kerbal on Minimus" src="assets/uploads/norobots/uploads/2013/08/Screen-Shot-2013-08-11-at-23.26.261.png" width="700" height="437" /></p>
<p>Good. Great. We now we have a kerbal stranded on the surface of Minmus. Normally, this is where I'd just try to land repeatedly on the surface, wiping out a generation of kerbal sons and daughters, but I'm going to try something else; I'm going to send a rescue mission for that little guy.</p>

<p>* I say heroic. I mean incredibly stupid.</p>
